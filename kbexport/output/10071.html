<h1>How do I add images to a KB article</h1><h2>10071</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article will explain, step-by-step, how to properly&nbsp;add images to a JMJ KB article.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><br></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><br></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><br></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><p>All images for the JMJ KB should be stored in <a href="file://wwwserver/jmjprod/kb/images">\\wwwserver\jmjprod\kb\images</a>, preferably in a folder unique to that article.</p><p>Create a folder named after the Article ID, or the ArticleNumber, which can be found at the top of the KB Article Edit page,after the article has been saved and assigned an ID and Number.&nbsp;So for this article, I created this folder: <a href="file://wwwserver/jmjprod/kb/images/10071">\\wwwserver\jmjprod\kb\images\10071</a>.&nbsp; This is where I will place all my images.</p><p>Adding the image to your article once it is in the folder you made:</p><ol><li>Click the<strong> Insert Image</strong> button on the toolbar<br><img alt="Insert Image Button" src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10071/insimgbut.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0"><br></li><li>Type in the https:// address to your image.&nbsp; Do <strong>not</strong> use the browse button.&nbsp; The address to your image should look like <strong>https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/<foldername>/<imagename> and in the Alternative Text field you put what text you would like to appear when a user mouses over the image<br><img alt="Insert Image Form" src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10071/insimgform.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0"><br></imagename></foldername></strong></li><li><strong>Then, of course,click OK.&nbsp; Now the image is in your article.&nbsp; If you want toedit the properties of your inserted image, simply select it and clickthe <strong>Insert Image</strong> button again.</strong></li></ol></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>Saving your images in GIF format will make them lower quality, but willtake up much less space on the server and also make them load muchfaster.<br><br>Also, the image controls don't work in Firefox as well as they do in IE. <br>Either use IE or code the image attributes in the html code.<br></p>
