<h1>Adding rooms</h1><h2>10088</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article explains how to add rooms to EncounterPRO.<br><br>At this time, there is no way to do this thru the interface. This mustbe done thru the database, either in SQL Enterprise Manager, or in MSAccess cpr.mdb.<br></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><br></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This will usually involve only inserting rows into two tables: o_group_rooms and o_rooms.<br><br>O_rooms holds the info specifying things like: room_id, what the nameof the room is, what its type is, what order the room shows in relationto other rooms.<br><br>O_group_rooms specifies what rooms show in which groups by matching a room_id with a group_id.<br><br>Groups are the tabs on the right side of the Office view. Examples of standard groups are Office, Telephone, Chart Room.<br>O_Groups specifies group names and group_ids. This table is usuallyuseful only for knowing what group_id goes with which group name.<br><br>When a request comes in to add a room that requires adding a group, a row will have to be inserted into o_groups.<br><br>Sometimes a request will be specific to a particular location of apractice that has multiple locations. In this case, table c_office willalso have to be taken into account.<br></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><br></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1:</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Add an exam room to the office tab. This will be the 3rd exam room in the office.</span><br>If the group_id of the office tab is 109 (after finding this out from o_groups), go to o_rooms, insert a row where <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room_id=EXAM3, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room_name=Exam 3, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room_sequence is greater than the first two exam rooms, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room_type= that of other exam rooms (usually $EXAMINATION)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room_status=OK<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; office_id= that of other exam rooms (usually 0001)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; status=OK<br>Next, go to o_group_rooms and insert a row where group_id=109 and room_id=EXAM3<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 2:</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There are two Waiting rooms already added. The practice wants to get rid of those and have just one Waiting room.</span><br>In O_rooms set the status (not the room_status) of the already existingWaiting rooms to NA. Add a row to o_rooms, like the already existingWaiting rooms where room_type=$WAITING.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: </span>Waiting rooms do not require a row in o_group_rooms or o_groups. <br></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><br></p>
