<h1>User cannot delete PFSH items</h1><h2>10100</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>The user attempts to delete one or more PFSH items, but they never disappear from the PFSH review screen.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>If the user reviews a PFSH and wishes to remove an item, they click on the results pane and select "Reviewed with changes" and on the edit screen they drill down as appropriate and remove an item.&nbsp; The item appears to be removed but when they exit the edit screen the PFSH review screen still shows the removed items.</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This problem is caused by the logic of the PFSH display, which attempts to locate and display the last time each PFSH "question" was answered.&nbsp; When an item is deleted, the process does not see the deleted item so it goes back in time to when the item was not deleted and shows that answer.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>Apply Hotfix 33.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>Either upgrade the database to mod level 124 or apply Hotfix 33.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
