<h1>Setting up Signature Stamp Files</h1><h2>10103</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This describes what to do when a practice gives signatures to be scanned into the pratice's system.<br></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><br></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><br></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><br></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>First, scan the page(s) with the signature(s) on it. Save the image as a black and white bitmap, filename=(practice name).bmp.<br><br>Next, open the bitmap file with MS Paint, chop it up so only thesignature image is shown. (If a signer has gone over the lines of thestandard signature form, you may ask the user to sign it again makingsure they stay inside the box; or you can clean it up in Paint. It's upto you.) If a page has signatures from multiple users on it, savechanges for each signature to a separate file. Name each file after theuser.<br><br>Move each signature file to the following directory in a folder nameed after the practice. <br>\\Dellserv\Common\Support\Signatures<br>If no folder for the practice exists, create one.<br><br>Copy each signature file to <br>\\Wwwserver\ftproot\temp<br><br>Go to the practice's server and connect to our ftp site.<br>Move the signature file(s) to the bitmaps folder in the cprfiles folderon the practice's server. (Make sure you don't leave a copy of thisfile on our ftp server.)<br><br>Go to EncounterPRO, Configuration, Users, select the user, Edit,Signature Stamp, browse to the bitmaps folder in the cprfiles folder onthe practice's server. Select the bitmap file. Save changes to the userand it should then be ready to go.<br></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><br></p>
