<h1>Message incorrectly attached to patient</h1><h2>10107</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>When a user creates a message from inside a patient chart, the patient context is automatically associated with the message.&nbsp; When a user creates a message from the "Messages" tab, there should be no patient context.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>A user creates a message from the "Messages" tab (without any patient context)&nbsp;and sends it to another user.&nbsp; When the recipient reads the message, it appears to be associated with a specific patient.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>EncounterPRO automatically associates a new message with the current patient, if there is one.&nbsp; Normally, when the user finishes performing services and returns to the office/room view&nbsp;the patient context in memory is cleared out so that any further operations (messages, utilites, config, etc.) are done without any patient context.&nbsp; However, when the user clicks on a service ordered for someone else, and then clicks "No" on the "Do you wish to take ownership..." popup, EncounterPRO fails to clear the patient context out of memory so a message created immediately afterwards will be associated with the clicked patient.</P><P>If instead of creating a new message the user clicks a service for a different patient, EncounterPRO will recognize the new patient context and correctly clear out the previous patient context.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>If the user clicks "No" on the "Do you wish to take ownership..." popup, they can immediately log out and log back in again to clear the patient context.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This problem was fixed in EncounterPRO 4.05.33.7.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
