<h1>Removing the patient context from a message or todo item</h1><h2>10110</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>Sometimes a message gets associated with a patient inadvertently due to user error or a bug in EncounterPRO.&nbsp; When this happens, there is currently no way in EncounterPRO to remove the patient context from the workplan item.</P><P>One such bug was fixed in EncounterPRO 33.7:</P><P><A href="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/Article.aspx?ArticleNumber=10107">Article #10107 - Message incorrectly attached to patient</A></P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>On the message tab, a patient name appears to the right of the sender for a message which should not be associated with a patient.&nbsp; On the message read/review screen, a patient name and context appear below the Sent and Received dates.</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This can be caused by the user sending a message from within a chart which automatically associates the message with the current patient.&nbsp; This can also be caused by EncounterPRO bug which incorrectly associates the message with the last patient the user touched even though there is no current patient context.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>To remove the association with the patient, first find the patient_workplan_item_id for the message or todo item in question.&nbsp; In build 4.05.34 and later this can be found on the service property screen by clicking on the left-side icon in the message or todo list.&nbsp; Prior to build 4.05.34, you can execute the stored procedure jmj_list_messages_for_day to display all of the messages sent by a user on a particular day</P><P>To list all of the messages, including the patient_workplan_item_id values,&nbsp;for a user for a day, execute the following SQL command in a query window, substituting the actual user_id and date for the parameters:</P><P>EXECUTE jmj_list_messages_for_day&nbsp;'&lt;user_id&gt;', '&lt;date&gt;'</P><P>To remove the patient context from a message, execute the following SQL command in a query window, substituting the actual patient_workplan_item_id for &lt;wpitem&gt;<PATIENT_WORKPLAN_ITEM_ID>:</P><P><CODE>EXECUTE jmj_remove_patient_context_from_wp_item &lt;wpitem&gt;<PATIENT_WORKPLAN_ITEM_ID></CODE></P><P>Note that the stored procedures jmj_remove_patient_context_from_wp_item&nbsp;and jmj_list_messages_for_day&nbsp;are defined in 4.05&nbsp;mod levels 123 and 126 respectively.&nbsp; If the customer database is earlier than mod level 126, you can define both stored procedures by applying Hotfix # 37.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
