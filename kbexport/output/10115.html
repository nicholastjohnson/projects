We have&nbsp;increased it to 32000, but that wonâ€™t take effect until build 4.0</FONT></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>To see which signatures are too large follow the below steps</P><UL><LI>Run below script in Query Anazlyer</LI></UL><P>Select cpr_id, attachment_id</P><P>from p_attachment_object</P><P>where datalenght (object_test) &gt;4099</P><UL><LI>You will see two columns. The first column is the CPR_ID and the second is the attachment ID <LI>Filter for CPR_ID in p_attachment object. <LI>Highlight record for the attachment_ID and see who created this record in the created_by field <LI>You will need to find another signature from the same User_ID in the created_by field <LI>Copy good signature in the offending field <LI>Open chart and confirm that it looks correct</LI></UL></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
