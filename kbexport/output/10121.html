<h1>Centricity 04 Upgrade</h1><h2>10121</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><p>This article explains the issues involved with Centricity 04 upgrade. The install must be Centricity 2004 with SP1.</p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><p>a) When checking a resource appointments they are created for doctorin EncounterPRO - still unresolved with 04. We are trying to find folksfrom Centricity to resolve this. For now, we need to setup EncounterPROservices in a seperate workstation in order for them to work</p><p>b) Patients not crossing over or not checking in. - This is fixed byinstalling the latest AHCHL7ASCII.DLL and re-registering it. Copy thisDLL from our ftp site under ep_integrations\centricity2004 folder.</p><p>c) If SP1 (Service Pack 1) not installed then they may experiencecheck in problems frequently. This is a MIK error and was resolved inSP1.</p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><p>WHY RESOURCE APPOINTMETS NOT HANDELED PROPERLY WITH 04:</p><p>We have got 4 other sites upgraded to Centricity 04 SP1 and they aredoing well so far. We have noticed one problem with check in. Againthat’s to do with DLL. Somehow the resource segment is not readablethru DLL and so any resource appointments scheduled are crossing overunder their doctor instead of the actual resource. In other words, ifyou look at the GE Scheduling [edit] screen there are 2 fields,Resource and Doctor. If both are same then there is no problem if theresource is different from doctor then on encounterpro side all theencounters are created under doctor because the DLL couldn’t recognizethe resource segments.</p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>If possible install eproservices and MIK in a seperate workstation.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><p>UPDATE FROM GE FOR MID LEVEL PROVIDER ISSUE WITH MIK 2004:</p><p>Centricity agreed that they made some changes in the DLL thatintroduced this bug. they are going to fix the DLL with SP3 and releaseit by end of June 2005.</p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><br></p>
