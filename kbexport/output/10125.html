<h1>Sendout Test report is not printing out all the ordered send out tests</h1><h2>10125</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Sendout Test report is not printing out all the ordered send out tests</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>The Sendout test report does not have all of the send out tests ordered for the patient in the encounter.. &nbsp;</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>The Sendout test report is dependent on a treatment mode workplan assigned for send out test.</P><P>This is a 'legacy' problem. The new enhanced Encounterpro, will have a new treatment type of 'Lab Referral' where this problem will go away. Originally it was thought that labs would be 'in-house', so the default treatment mode is set to Lab Collect Perform. Setting the default treatment mode to 'ong send out or refer out' workplan will not correct the problem, as the report stored proc looks for key phrases in the p_treatment_item. The correct fix is to select the 'alternate' treatment mode of 'ong send out or refer out'&nbsp;<FONT size=2></P><P>&nbsp;</P></FONT></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>For the&nbsp;Ordered /Lab select the alternate treatment mode 'ong send out or refer out'&nbsp;<FONT size=2></FONT></P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>For the&nbsp;Ordered /Lab select the alternate treatment mode 'ong send out or refer out'&nbsp;<FONT size=2></FONT></P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
