<h1>Lab Integration Testing Model</h1><h2>10155</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Testing of lab integrations will be required for current LabCorp integration testing, improvements made to LabCorp integration,&nbsp;clients who implement lab integration, and future lab integrations.&nbsp; This article is an attempt to assist with the testing process.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><OL dir=ltr><LI><DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left>Refer to KB article #10098 <A href="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/Article.aspx?ArticleNumber=10098">Article #10098 - Lab Integration EPRO configuration</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;for guidance on the configuration for EncounterPRO as related to the lab integration.<BR></DIV><LI>After you have configured EncounterPRO, you will need to find an .xml file in which to import.&nbsp; You can find a few&nbsp;sample files on the ftp site <A href="ftp://www.jmjtech.com/temp/">ftp://www.jmjtech.com/temp/</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have named them SAMPLEXML, SAMPLEXML2, AND SAMPLEXML3.<BR><LI>Once you have grabbed the .xml file and downloaded it to the computer or server that you will be testing from you will need to edit the patient ID within the file to match the ID of your test patient.&nbsp; The .xml file can be edited with notepad and looks really cluttered.&nbsp; If you "wrap" the text in notepad you should find a line that looks like this:&nbsp; <PATIENTRECORD><PATIENTID><PATIENTIDDOMAIN>JMJBillingID</PATIENTIDDOMAIN><PATIENTID>1039</PATIENTID></PATIENTID><PATIENTID><BR>Edit the Patient ID to match your test patient and make sure that you look at what lab(s) are contained in the xml file so that you can order those labs for your test patient.&nbsp; Please note that if you are in a client's site, you need to make sure that you order and post to the correct labs to prevent lab/result associations that are false (see article 10098 for explanation).<BR><LI>After you have ordered and "collected" the labs for your test patient, import the .xml file into the Scan/Post Utility using file import, and post the results to the labs.&nbsp; If the treatment mode is configured correctly, the ordering provider (or whomever you specify in the workplan) should receive a todo item for the treatment dashboard.<BR><LI>At step number 4, assuming all went well,&nbsp;you should know whether the posting of results will work.&nbsp; Now simply check the daily referrals report that you configured earlier (step 1), and you should be able to tell the the results were received and reviewed.&nbsp; The report will not show a reviewed status if you did not send a todo item from the treatment dashboard to a user and open that subsequent todo item.</LI></OL></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
