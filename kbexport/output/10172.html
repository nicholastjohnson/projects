<h1>Billing is not going over to PMS</h1><h2>10172</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article explains the possible reasons for the bills not generated from EncounterPro</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>a) None of them are posting.</P><P>b) few patients bills not going out</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>a) None of them are posting:</P><P>the only possiblity is that the billing service or Transport Out &nbsp;is not &nbsp;running or not enabled in o_server_component. </P><P>Exception:</P><P>At Shands Clinics&nbsp; the billing is set as scheduled service in o_service_schedule. so the #BILL entry is disabled or removed from o_server_component.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>b) Few Patients bills NOT CROSSED over</P><P>if you see a green $ or green tick mark icon in check out for that patient then the bill is successfully sent from encounterpro. some systems returns acknowledgements so that case it would be a dollar bill. a dollar bill means the bill was successfully received in PMS.</P><P>if you see a Red tick or message icon that means the bill is not successfully sent from encounterpro.</P><P>if you see a Red (cross) $ then there are some errors in processing the bill or it received a rejection from PMS.</P><P>If you see an envelope icon that means a billing message is queued up in o_message_log but transport out didnt send them. Make sure transport out is running.&nbsp; If yes then most probably there is an error while generating a billing message. check the event viewer.</P><P>run this below query to see whether it returned any results: if it does and billing service is running then send them to "interface group" for troubleshooting further.</P><P>exec sp_get_todo_list_30 '#BILL',null,null,null,null</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>If it's a centricity PMS , i will suggest to run the following&nbsp;query from FTP site&nbsp;to generate list of ICD and CPT that we tried to send but missing in their system. Centricity will reject the entire bill if it could not find a match for either one ore more ICD / CPT.</P><P>find the query file EPRO to Millbrook ICD-CPT Check.sql from FTP under EP_Integrity_Check_Scripts folder. </P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
