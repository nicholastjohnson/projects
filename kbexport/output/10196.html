<h1>Spirometer interface  EncounterPRO configuration</h1><h2>10196</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>Below is an explanation of setting up EncounterPRO to accept files generated by a spirometer.&nbsp; As of 2/26/05, the only spirometer that will work within EncounterPRO is the Brentwood/Midmark IQMark digital spirometer.&nbsp; There will be other spirometer devices that we will eventually interface with, but they make/model of spirometer should not effect the EncounterPRO observation configuration described below.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>NOTE: <A href="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/Article.aspx?ArticleNumber=10146">Article #10146 - Setting up Spirometer integration</A>&nbsp;is an article outlining the installation of the spirometer device, and is part of the total installation.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><OL><LI>Identify all of the observations that the practice will use to obtain spirometry results.&nbsp; There is typically one observation that the practice will use consistently, but make sure not to miss any other cpt codes that they will use.<BR><LI>Order the observation(s):&nbsp;<BR><IMG alt="Order Spirometer Screenshot" hspace=0 src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10196/spiroconfig1.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp; <LI>Configure the observation.&nbsp; After ordering the test and when you are in the Drilldown menu, select other options, configure.&nbsp; Note: Users can also configure observations from the configuration tab. In this case, go to Configuration, Observations, Test, Spirometry*<BR><BR><LI>Configure attachment&nbsp;results by clicking on Perform, Attachment, click on the big blank grey square, New Result. <BR><BR><LI>Add a new result to the attachment result (ex. Spirometer, Spirometer results, Spiro results, etc...), i.e., under the text box for "Result from External Source",&nbsp;type in Spirometer Results.&nbsp;Set the external source to "Spirometer, &lt;Any&gt;."&nbsp;<BR><BR><LI>Finally, setup the fat client's external sources to acknowledge the device.&nbsp; Go to configuration; external sources, and select spirometer.&nbsp; After doing these configuration steps, making sure that all of the correct spirometer software is installed, and ensuring that the spirometer is functional, you should see a green line in the result that was created in the observation.<BR><BR><LI>If there is a problem with any step in the process you will notice a red line (shown below), indicating that there is something wrong in the setup.<BR><BR></LI></OL></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
