<h1>Adding charges to the Billing Sheet of an encounter</h1><h2>10206</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>The Billing Sheet currently displays $0.00 for the office visit and any procedures. Clients have asked for a way to display charges and print the statement for patients. If the charge for a procedure is added to the line item, the user must select 'Update Master' to have the charge display on the Billing Sheet. This will not allow the charge to revert back to $0.00 for subsequent use of that procedure.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>The Billing Sheet is an editable document. Simply click directly in line with the procedure for which a charge is to be added. A field will appear into which the dollar amount can be added. Press either Tab or Enter to move down to the next item line, or if there is only one item, to calculate the total charge(s) for the encounter.</P><P>Likewise, the procedure description and CPT code is also editable, if desired.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
