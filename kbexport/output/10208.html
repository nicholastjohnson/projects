EXAM1) <LI>Type a room description in the Room_name field.  Please note that whatever you type here will display in EncounterPRO.  Also, that there is a character limit and if you put in a long name it may cut part of it off. <LI>The next field is room_sequence.  This will sort the rooms in encounterPRO. Ex. If Room 1 has a room_sequence of  3 and Room 2 has 1 then Room 2 will show in EncounterPRO before Room 1. <LI>The next field is the room_type.  Please enter in either $EXAMINATION or $TELEPHONE.  Most rooms will use $EXAMINATION and $TELEPHONE is used for telephones rooms. <LI>Room _status should be set to OK. <LI>computer_id should be left blank unless you are wanting to set a coumputer to open with a default room.  If this is the case you have to go into the o_computers table and get the computer_id for the computer you want to set. <LI>office_id is usually set to 0001 unless you have multiple offices.  If you have multiple offices you can get the office_id from the c_office table. <LI>status is set to OK.
