<h1>Cannot create new results for observation in version 2</h1><h2>10212</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>An observation can only have 32767 results created for it.&nbsp; Once this number is reached for any given observation, no more results will be able to be created.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>If you click on an observation and click on Result and try to enter an result on the fly it throws this error: </P><P>u_sqlca - (check()) SQL ERROR = (515) Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'result_sequence', table 'cpr.dbo.c_Observation_Result'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails. </P><P>It also does the same thing in configuration.</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>The result_sequence field in c_Observation_Result is a 2-byte integer.&nbsp; 2-byte integers can have a maximum value of 32767.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>We cannot fix the existing maxed-out observation, but we can create a new observation which will look and act just like the old one but without all the old results.&nbsp; Then we can replace the old observation with the new one on all the shortlists and treatment lists.&nbsp; The logic to do all&nbsp;this is in the sp_replace_observation stored procedure.</P><P>First, apply Quickfix 2.21.44.04 to create the "sp_replace_observation" stored procedure.</P><P>Second, determine the observation_id of the maxed-out observation and executre the sp_replace_observation stored preocedure like this:</P><P>EXECUTE sp_replace_observation '&lt;&lt;observation_id&gt;&gt;<OBSERVATION_ID>'</P><P>Where &lt;&lt;observation_id&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<OBSERVATION_ID>is the maxed-out observation_id.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This issue is fixed in EncounterPRO version 4</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
