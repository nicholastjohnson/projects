<h1>Patient portrait not showing</h1><h2>10213</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Patient picture does not show up in portrait box on the SOAP screen or demographics screen,&nbsp;but is in the list of attachments displayed when the portrait box is clicked.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>Prior to EncounterPRO 35,&nbsp;the portrait box&nbsp;would not display the portrait if the attachment title was other than "Portrait".&nbsp; Prior to EncounterPRO 33, the title of an imported portrait was hard coded as "Portrait" so the portraits always displayed.&nbsp; The EncounterPRO Client version 33 introduced more flexibility in the attachment file importing screens so that now the users may change the attachment title.&nbsp; In EncounterPRO Client version 35, the portrait box is smartened to display the portrait no matter what it's title is.&nbsp; That means the with EncounterPRO Client version 33 and 34, if the user imports a portrait and gives it a title other than "Portrait", it will not display in the portrait box.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P><BR>Hotfix 88 adds logic to a trigger to make sure that any attachment imported into the portrait folder is automatically shown in the portrait box on the SOAP screen and on the demographics screen.&nbsp; It will also re-connect any portraits which were imported into the Portraits folder already but were not given the title "Portrait".</P><P>After running Hotfix 88, the users no longer need to name the attachment "Portrait", even if they're using client version 33 or 34.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><BR></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><BR></p>
