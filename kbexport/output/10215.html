<h1>Backup Check Warning</h1><h2>10215</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>Each time a user logs in, EncounterPRO will check to see if a recent database backup has been performed, and a warning will be displayed to the user if no recent database backup is found.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Sometimes users get this message even when a recent backup has been performed.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>EncounterPRO uses the following query to determine the last time the database was backed up:</P><P>SELECT max(backup_finish_date)<BR>FROM msdb..backupset<BR>WHERE database_name = '{database}'</P><P>where {database} is replaced with the appropriate database name.</P><P>This only works when the backup process logs records into the msdb database.&nbsp; The SQL Server "BACKUP DATABASE" command will always log into the msdb database.&nbsp; The msdb database is not required for normal SQL Server operations, so if it has become corrupt or missing then users might not know other than the backup check warning.&nbsp; Also, there are third party backup/recovery systems which might not log records into the msdb database.<BR></P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>The backup warning check can be disabled by adding a record to o_Preferences where the preference type is ‘SYSTEM’ and the preference_id is ‘disable_backup_check’ and the preference value is ‘True’.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Make sure the msdb database is operational and that the backup process is logging records into it.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
