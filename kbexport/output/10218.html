<h1>RTF Reports show  Page  of X  in footer</h1><h2>10218</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When the user views an RTF report, and then clicks "Edit" to bring up the report in an editor such as Microsoft Word, the page number in the footer of every page reads "Page: of X" instead of having the appropriate numbers.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>When an RTF report is generated, the page numbers are not know because they can change based on the size of the display control and other dynamic factors.&nbsp; The numbers are actually calculated immediately before printing to insure their accuracy.&nbsp; The "Edit" button on the report display screen writes the RTF report to a file without calculating the page numbers.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>The "View" button on the bottom of the RTF report display screen changes the display to show the entire page, including header and footer information.&nbsp; The "View" button does calculate the page numbers so that they appear correctly on the screen.&nbsp; If the user therefore clicks "View" and then clicks "Edit", the page numbers will appear in the document correctly.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This problem has been fixed in EncounterPRO version 4.05.34.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
