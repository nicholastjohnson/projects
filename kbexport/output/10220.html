<h1>Health maintenance treatment doesn't change health maintenance due date</h1><h2>10220</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>When a Health Maintenance rule is overdue, the providers will order the appropriate treatment to bring the health maintenance item up to date.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the health maintenance item does not appear to change.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>A treatment is ordered which should affect the due date for a health maintenance item, but the due date appears unaffected.&nbsp; Furthermore, when the health maintenance item is clicked in the patient chart, the Maintenance Rule Status screen pops up&nbsp;and should show all the treatments associated with that health maintenance item.&nbsp; The treatment in question may or may not be there.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>The two most common causes for treatments not affecting a health maintenance item as expected are:</P><P>1)&nbsp; The treatment must be closed before the due date is updated.&nbsp; If this is the case the treatment will still appear on the Maintenance&nbsp;Rule Status&nbsp;screen.</P><P>2)&nbsp; The treatment appears to be associated with the health maintenance item, but behind the scenes the necessary link between the treatment and the health maintenance item has not been established.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>If the treatment has not yet been closed, then complete the appropriate steps to close the treatment.</P><P>If the treatment does not appear on the Maintenance Rule Status screen, then EncounterPRO does not recognize the relationship between the treatment and the health maintenance rule.</P><P>The relationship between a treatment and a health maintenance rule is establisheb by listing all of the appropriate Procedures on the health maintenance procedures screen.&nbsp; When a treatment is ordered which directly references&nbsp;a procedure (e.g.&nbsp;office procedure or office medication), then the treatment's procedure is directly compared to the health maintenance procedures.&nbsp; If the treatment does not reference a procedure directly, but references a root observation (e.g.&nbsp; lab, test, questionnaire, etc), then the treatment is considered to be associated with the health maintenance item if the "Perform Procedure" of the root observation is in the list of procedures for the health maintenance item.&nbsp; The most likely cause of an observation-style treatment not affecting a health maintenance item is that the root observation either does not have a Perform Procedure, or that the observation's Perform Procedure is not on the list for the health maintenance item.&nbsp; The solution is therefore to add the observation's Perform Procedure to the health maintenance item's list of procedures using the Health Maintenance Configuration screens.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
