<h1>Sorting items on the office and room views</h1><h2>10222</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>Prior to build 34, the items on the office an room views were always sorted by patient name, and then within patient name ther were sorted by the age of the item with the oldest at the top.&nbsp; The waiting room always sorted by waiting time descending.</P><P>Beginning with build 34, the office view,&nbsp;room view, and waiting room tab may be optionally sorted by patient name, ascending, or &nbsp;the age of the encounter, either ascending or descending.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>The sort order for each room&nbsp;is controlled by records in the o_Preferences table.&nbsp; The desgniation of a sort order for a room affects all the items in that room whether they appear on the office view or the room view.&nbsp; There is currently no user interface for creating/editing room-specific records in the o_Preferences table, so this feature may only be enabled by qualified support personnel.</P><P>To designate the sort order for a specific room, add a record to o_Preferences as follows:</P>preference_type = 'SYSTEM'<BR>preference_level = 'Room'<BR>preference_key = &lt;Room_id&gt;<ROOM_ID><ROOM_ID><BR>preference_id = 'sort'<BR>preference_value = 'Patient' or 'Encounter Ascending' or 'Encounter Descending' <P>The Waiting Rooms tab is not able to sort different waiting rooms differently.&nbsp; Therefore, to set the sort preference for the Waiting Room tab, use '$Waiting' as the &lt;Room_id&gt; instead of any specific waiting room id.</P><P>The default sort preference for waiting rooms is 'Encounter Descending'.&nbsp; The default sort preference for all other rooms is 'Patient'.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
