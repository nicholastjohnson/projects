<h1>Extracting New   Existing Report Requirements from Customers</h1><h2>10238</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><p>This article explains what to ask from a customer and what JMJ development requires for any&nbsp;new report requirements.</p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><p>a) The customer is looking for some report that is not found in EPRO report system</p><p>b) The customer wants to add more details in existing reports.</p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><p><u><strong><font size="4">Requirements for New&nbsp;/ Updating existing report </font></strong></u></p><p>1) If this is a brand new report, then get a <strong>report template</strong>(with all the details they need)&nbsp;from the customer and create an issue for "Development new". By reviewing the requirements, JMJ development notify the support how much it'll cost ($$) to implement and what report release that would be available.</p><p>2) If this is an enhacement or add-on for our existing reports, we still need the report template on what needs to be added. Based on the requirments, we again decide whether it's something we customize only for this customer or make it as a permanent change to all our customers. This might or might not cost and again JMJ development will notify after reviewing the details.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
