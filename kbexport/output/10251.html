<h1>Selecting default specialty for Refer Patient screen</h1><h2>10251</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>When you click on "Patient Referred To:" or "Specimen Sent To:" and get the Refer Patient for Treatment screen, the specialty that this screen defaults to is determined by&nbsp;treatment type in&nbsp;c_treatment_type.referral_specialty_id.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Example:&nbsp; Whenever you order an x-ray and determine where the patient should be sent to, and you click on the "Patient Referred to" property, the specialty that the screen defaults to is "Radiology."&nbsp; Well, there aren't any radiologists in your area, but you do have two local hospitals that will take Xrays for physicians, so you want to change the default to Hospitals.&nbsp; First, look in c_specialty to see that the id for Hospitals is $HOSP3.&nbsp; Then go to c_treatment_type and find the record for XRAY and set the field referral_specialty_id to $HOSP3.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
