<h1>Duplicate tickets created in Centricity for PA's encounters</h1><h2>10256</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><p>This article explains why the duplicate tickets are generated in Centricity while posting charges.</p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><br></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><p>Duplicate tickets are generated because,</p><p>a) charges are going out to bill under PA's account </p><p>b) the patient is MANUALLY checked in. While posting the charges,Centricity matches with existing visit record by DOS, &amp; scheduleddoctor. If the scheduled doctor is different from the encounter ownerit'll then duplicate the tickets. This is the behavior of theCentricity system. </p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><p><strong><u>Version 2</u></strong></p><p>Make sure they are version 2.21.44 and the interface PBDs are up to date. Look up the latest PBDs in FTP site in this folder:<br>EP_Integrations\Version 2.21\2.21.44<br>Copy the files to the EncounterPRO installed folder.&nbsp; (Make sureyou rename the old pbd before copying the new one to the folder.)<br> </p><p>If the encounter owner is not assigned wtih "billing id" then assigna supervisor to bill all those provider encounters under the supervisoraccount.</p><p><strong><u>Version 4</u></strong></p><p>Versions higher than 33.7 is not a problem. For 33.7 there is a fixin FTP site. For 33.7 and below, this can happen if the charges aregoing out under PA's name instead their supervisors..</p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><p>a) Upgrade them EproServer 2.2 or higher</p><p>b) If they are on version 33.7 then try installing the fixes from 33.7 folder in FTP site.</p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><br></p>
