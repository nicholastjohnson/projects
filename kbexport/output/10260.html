<h1>Prescription description gets cut off when prescription is modified</h1><h2>10260</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>When a prescription is modified, some of the description from the original is cut off and not included in the modified prescription.</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>Only the first 80 characters of the treatment description are stored in the p_Treatment_Item table.&nbsp; Any descriptions longer than 80 characters are stored in the p_Treatment_Progress table.&nbsp; When a treatment is modified, a copy of the p_Treatment_Item record is created but, prior to mod level 127 (or Hotfix 60), the associated p_Treatment_Progress record was not copied so the treatment description appeared to be truncated to 80 characters.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>If the customer database is below mod level 119, upgrade the database.</P><P>If the customer database is between mod level 119 and 126 (inclusively), apply hotfix 60.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This is fixed in Mod Level 127 (dev issue # 5814)</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
