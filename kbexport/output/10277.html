<h1>SQL MemoryRAM Allocation & Usage</h1><h2>10277</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>this article whether to use dynamic or fixed SQL memory allocation.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><FONT size=2><P>Question From <A href="mailto:Jenny@Support">Jenny@Support</A>:</P><P>I see changes being made with regards to the memory allocation in SQL.&nbsp; JMJ use to want it set to Dynamic allocation and now I keep seeing it as fixed allocation and the same amount of RAM at each - 2147?</P></FONT><FONT face=Arial></FONT><FONT size=2><P>Has JMJ determined that EncounterPRO works better with a fixed allocation?&nbsp; If so what formula do they use to determine the fixed amount to use?&nbsp; If not then someone is changing it at some of our larger sites.</P></FONT></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>there are 2 types of memory allocation (Fixed / Dynamic). JMJ used to set the dynamic memory allocation and some cases it noticed that the SQL was not using enough allocated memory for it's usage. so we used to go by Fixed Memory Allocation and set this level depends on size of the practice and available RAM. for very large practices just leave them in dynamic memory allocation.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
