<h1>Object-level confidentiality</h1><h2>10305</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>In order to make the object-level confidentiality functions accessible, we use buttons to add progress notes.&nbsp; These buttons&nbsp;create a Progress Note with the context object you want to make confidential (patient, encounter, DX, treatment) and the progress note type of Confidential and the subject needs to be Deny or Allow (deny to restrict and allow to un-restrict). I would think that the patient-level button would go on the Patient Demographics screen, the Encounter-level button on the SOAP screen, other items; the DX and treatment buttons on their respective dashboard screens.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>Text taken from the dev issue (5926) - buttons added in config 24 and functionality exists in 4.05.34.7.</p>
