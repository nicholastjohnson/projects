<h1>Sent Message list takes too long to display</h1><h2>10317</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When the user is on the Messages tab and selects the "Sent Messages" folder, EncounterPRO appears to freeze for a long time before the sent messages are displayed.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This is caused by EncounterPRO's default behavior of retrieving all sent messages for all time from the database.&nbsp; When a customer has been using EncounterPRO for a long time this can be a substantial amount of data.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>There is a general preference called "000Standard Sent Items Display Date Range" or "Sent Items Display Date Range" which will limit the messages displayed to a period of time.&nbsp; Valid units are "Year", "Month" and "Day".&nbsp; Examples are:</P><P>3 Months<BR>30 Days<BR>1 Year</P><P>The shorter the time period, the less data so the faster the response.&nbsp; At this point, however, EncounterPRO does not have an easy way to get back to earlier messages without resetting the preference.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This has been identified as a problem and reported as Dev Issue # 6027.&nbsp; It will be addressed in EncounterPRO Client version 4.05.35.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
