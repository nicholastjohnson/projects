<h1>SOAP Screen is blank for some patient charts</h1><h2>10334</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>For some patient charts, the SOAP screen comes up blank.&nbsp; Often, when the user clicks the Previous Encounter button ("&lt;&lt;"), the SOAP screen then populates correctly.&nbsp; In the event viewer, an error message like this appears:</P><P>Invalid row range at line 72 in function find_user of object u_component_security<BR></P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>Posting an attachment to an Encounter folder will prompt the user to select an existing encounter or create a new encounter.&nbsp; When the user selects Create Encounter, a new encounter record is created from the data entered by the user.&nbsp; Since "Encounter Owner" is not accessible on this screen, EncounterPRO should leave it NULL.&nbsp; A bug in EncounterPRO is causing the "Encounter Owner"&nbsp;field (p_Patient_Encounter.attending_doctor)&nbsp;to be populated with a blank space instead of a null.&nbsp; This causes the SOAP screen to report an error instead of populate itself with data.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>Hotfix 69 fixes this problem for databases on Mod Level 126.&nbsp; Hotfix 70 fixes this problem for databases which are on mod levels 111 - 125.</P><P>If that does not work run the below script</P><FONT size=2><P><FONT color=#000080>update c_user set supervisor_user_id = NULL where supervisor_user_id IS NOT NULL AND supervisor_user_id NOT IN ( SELECT user_id FROM c_User)</FONT> </P></FONT></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>This problem is fixed in both mod level 127 and in EncounterPRO client version 4.05.35.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
