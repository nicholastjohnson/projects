<h1>Unable to map more vaccines in c_report_attribute table</h1><h2>10336</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article explains a workaround for adding more vaccines that needs to show up on the immunization report.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><font size="2"><p>Currently the default character limit for the Value column is 255 in c_report_attribute&nbsp;and a report at a practice has used most of them and needs to add another vaccine.<br></p></font></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><p>This needs to be a build fix. We can resize the column. There is dev# 6122 created for this and assigned to work for 4.05.35 build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><p>We do few things until this enhancement is made and released</p><p>a). Find out list of vaccines ordered so far from p_treatment_item by running the following query. The list of vaccines already used must be included in the report and so make sure all those vaccine id's are referenced (or the ones practice wants to reference) in c_report_attribute table.</p><p>SELECT distinct drug_id, count(*) as count from p_treatment_item where treatment_type='Immunization' group by drug_id order by count desc<br></p><p>b) Find the unused vaccine id's from the c_report_attribute and remove them for now or just remove the vaccines that do not exists in p_treatment_item (from the query results above) and also with status of &nbsp;'NA' in c_Vaccine table.</p><p>&nbsp;Doing the above steps (may) will free up some space and helps to add some more vaccines.</p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
