<h1>How to find the billable provider for an encounter OR how epro is picking a billable provider</h1><h2>10337</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article explains how EncounterPro decides the billing providers while generating charges<br><br></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><p>a) Duplicate tickets created in centricity</p><p>b) Billable provider coming over from encounterpro is incorrect</p><p>c) Always bill under the patient primary provider for patients seen by "Dr.X"</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><p>a) The user is not mapped with his billable code (PM code) in c_user.billing_id </p><p>b) For the cases of billing under the supervisor, may be that "USER.X" is not assigned with a supervisor in c_user</p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><p>Here is how EncounterPro decides the billable provider for an encounter.</p><p>a) If any supervising physician is assigned to the encounter, then it bills under the supervising physician code</p><p>c) If&nbsp; the encounter owner is mapped with his external billing&nbsp;id (PM code) in c_user &amp; a supervisor is setup, then it bills under&nbsp;the supervisor account and also sends "encounter owner" details to notify who actually did the work. This is useful for practices to bill under supervisor but also know who actually did the work (PA's / NP's / CNP's)</p><p>b) If&nbsp; the encounter owner is&nbsp;not having&nbsp;his external billing&nbsp;id (PM code)&nbsp;&amp; assigned&nbsp;supervisor, then it bills under the supervisor code</p><p>d) If all the above are failed, then it bills to the patient primary provider. </p><p>e) If all the above failed then it reports "Billing Failed".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the cases of a) &amp; b) we are sending the billable provider plus the encounter owner (if it has the billing id) in our charge messages. This is because some of&nbsp; PM systems wanted to track who actually did the work (like PA's).</p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>as we continue to get so many calls about billable provider i decided to log this info in p_patient_encounter.encounter_billing_id column and so we can always verify who was the billable provider for that encounter at any given time. i am logging this enhancement request# 6127 for EPROSERVER 2.5 and as soon as it's released and all the encounters billed after installing EPROSERVER 2.5 will have this information.</p>
