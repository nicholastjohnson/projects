<h1>Modified prescription description reverts back to original description</h1><h2>10338</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When the user modifies a medication, the modified description appears on the Dashboard, but the original, unmodified description appears on the prescription report and on the SOAP screen.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>When a treatment is modified, EncounterPRO makes a copy of the p_Treatment_Item record, and then, because an extended treatment description might be stored in a p_Treatment_Progress record, EncounterPRO copies the latest treatment description progress record from the original treatment to the modified treatment.&nbsp; In some cases, particularly when the description is less than 80 characters, this overwrites the modified description with the original description.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>This problem was introduced with Hotfix 60.&nbsp; As of 7/21/2005, Hotfix 60 no longer causes this problem.&nbsp; The&nbsp;fix to this&nbsp;problem is&nbsp;also installed with&nbsp;Hotfix 73.</P><P>Neither hotfix repairs the already modified medications.&nbsp; To detect and repair the modified medications that might be affected by this problem, use the "Modified Medication Repair Utility" found on the "Tools" tab of EncounterPRO Server version 2.5 or later.</P><P>If the logic of the Modified Medication tool gets updtaed, the new logic will be deployed in the form of a Hotfix.&nbsp; Make sure the customer is up to date on their hotfixes before running the Modified Medication Repair Utility.&nbsp; As of this writing, the latest Hotfix for the repair utility was Hotfix 82.</P><P>Note that sometimes the Modified Medication Repair Utility shows treatments in need of repair even after a repair has just been done.&nbsp; If this happens, just run the Modified Medication Repair Utility one more time to clear the remaining medications.&nbsp; If running the utility a second time does not clear all of the treatments, contact JMJ Technical Support.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This problem is fixed in mod level 127.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
