<h1>Migrated Encounters don't show up on the Pick List for All Encounters</h1><h2>10342</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>the article explains why some of the encounter types (may be a v2 or v4) does not show on the encounter types popup list in 'all Encounter' report.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>a) not showing all the encounter types used in encounter table.</P><P>b) version 2 encounter types not showing</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>a) may be the encounter type used in encounter table but disabled (status = 'NA') in c_encounter_type</P><P>b) the encounter type exists in encounter table but not in c_encounter_type (may happen with migrated customers because we are not migrating encounter types)</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><FONT size=2><P><FONT size=3>This will be a problem only if they are filtering the encounters based on 'Encounter Type'. Yes, we do not migrate encounter types and I believe only this report allows encounters to be filtered based on encounter type. also the frequently used v2 encoutner types (like SICK / WELL / PHONE / TODO ) are already in version 4. </FONT></P><P><FONT size=3><STRONG><U>for a migrated customer:</U></STRONG> run the below query to see what encounter types are used in version 2 but missing in version 4</FONT></P><P><FONT size=3>select distinct encounter_type from p_patient_encounter<BR>where not exists<BR>(<BR>select * from c_encounter_type<BR>where c_encounter_type.encounter_type=p_patient_encounter.encounter_type<BR>)</FONT></P><P><FONT size=3>if they want this report to include any of the above&nbsp;encouner types then I will recommend adding them in c_encounter_type with status of 'NA'. Even doing this will not show on the popup because we filter out&nbsp;only records with status='OK'. I wonder why we should filter based on status because if we used the encounter type for a while and later disabled we still need our reports to show list of used encounter types (in encounter table) no matter whether that's currently enabled or disabled. I can discuss this with to mark and make&nbsp;changes if necessary in our master database.. But in order for all the encounter types (used in encoutner table) to show on the popup change the query in <STRONG><EM>c_component_param table</EM></STRONG> as below.</FONT></P><P><FONT size=3><EM><STRONG>For param_title = 'Select the desired encounter types'</STRONG></EM></FONT></P><P><FONT size=3><EM><STRONG>change&nbsp;the query field column&nbsp;= select description,encounter_type from c_encounter_type where encounter_type in (Select distinct encounter_type from p_patient_encounter)</STRONG></EM></FONT></P></FONT></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
