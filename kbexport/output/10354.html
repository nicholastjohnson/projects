<h1>Combining equivalent observations for flowsheets</h1><h2>10354</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>How to Combine several observations on a flowsheet</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Typically, when users have installed the lab results integration, they also desire the lab results to show on the flowsheets.&nbsp;The RTF command Patient Observations used for the Flowsheets, obtains the composite header observation. By reviewing this header observation in Configuration/Observations, you will see the list of detail observations to be collected under the composite observation on the flowsheet. Click on a detail observation, then click on the equivalence button. Search for the lab result observation from the lab integration. These observations will not be assigned to a speciality or a category. Add these observations as equivalent observations. Then check the flowsheet, to verify that that observation is what you wanted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
