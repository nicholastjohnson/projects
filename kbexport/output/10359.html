<h1>Importing portraits not working correctly</h1><h2>10359</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>When the user clicks on the portrait box on the chart or the patient demographics screen, the Attachment List screen is displayed.&nbsp; This screen is supposed to list all the portraits taken previously for this patient, and by clicking the "New Portrait" button the user can import a new portrait.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Sometimes, particularly after an upgrade,&nbsp;the&nbsp;attachment list screen doesn't list previous portraits.&nbsp; Also, client build 33 might start prompting the user for a folder.&nbsp; For portraits, the folder selection should be automatic.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>These behaviors are caused by a change in how EncounterPRO handles the placement of newly imported attachments into folders.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>Hotfix 88 adds logic to a trigger to make sure that any attachment imported into the portrait folder is automatically shown in the portrait box on the SOAP screen and on the demographics screen.&nbsp; It will also re-connect any portraits which were imported into the Portraits folder already but were not given the title "Portrait".</P><P>After running Hotfix 88, the users no longer need to name the attachment "Portrait", even if they're using client version 33 or 34.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This behavior is resolved in EncounterPRO Client 4.05.35.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
