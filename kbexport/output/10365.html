<h1>EPRO is not saving changes made to Billing Screen</h1><h2>10365</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>EncounterPRO will automatically recalculate the primary&nbsp;visit CPT code each time a user goes to the "Exit" tab in the chart.&nbsp; If, however, a user manually changes the primary visit code, EncounterPRO will stop automatically recalculating the code for that visit.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When the user deletes the primary visit code and then adds another primary visit code, EncounterPRO sometimes recalculates the primary visit code the next time the user brings up the Exit tab in the chart.&nbsp; In this case the change made by the user appears to vanish.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>When the user brings up the Exit tab in the chart, EncounterPRO looks for a progress note indicating whether or not any user has previously manually changed the primary visit code.&nbsp; If EncounterPRO does not find such a setting, then it automatically recalculates the primary visit code from the E&amp;M Level, Encounter Type, etc.</P><P>When the user changes the primary visit code by first deleting the existing primary visit code and then clicking "New Primary Visit Charge", EncounterPRO does not log a progress note indicating that the primary visit code has changed.</P><P>If, instead, the user clicks on the existing primary visit code and selects "Change" or "Change Level" from the pop up menu, then EncounterPRO does indeed log the appropriate progress note so that the primary visit code will no longer be automatically recalculated.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>When the user wishes to change the primary visit code, they should click on the visit code and select "Change" from the popup menu.&nbsp; All codes that are available from the "New Primary Visit Charge" popup are also available from the search screen that comes up when the user clicks "Change".&nbsp; The user may need to search for the desired code, but when found they will have the opportunity to put frequently used codes on the Short List.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This has been reported as Dev Issue # 6195 and is scheduled to be fixed in EncounterPRO Client version 4.05.35.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
