<h1>History screen freezes</h1><h2>10381</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When attempting to edit or create a new history, a popup window appears with the phrase "Expression is not valid".&nbsp; Then the history screen comes up but EncounterPRO is frozen.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This condition is cause by EncounterPRO attempting to display a comment on the history screen where the comment definition (or comment-title) contains a single quote character.&nbsp; EncounterPRO performs a search using the comment definition and the single quote character is used to delimit the paramters of the search.&nbsp; When one of the parameters contains a single quote, EncounterPRO does not create a valid search string.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>Hotfix 81 and DB Mod Level 127 have added logic to the database&nbsp;to substitute a backwards quote for the single quote for all comment definitions.&nbsp; This affects the records in p_Observation_Comment, c_Observation_Result, and, where appropriate, u_Top_20.</P><P>Do one of the following:</P><P>a) If the customer is between mod level 110 and 126, run Hotfix 81</P><P>OR</P><P>b)&nbsp;Upgrade the customer to mod level 127</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This has been reported as Issue # 6210 and will be fixed in a future release of EncounterPRO.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
