FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In exchange for payment of the application support and upgrade (“S&amp;U”) fee, JMJ will provide technical support via telephone and email (but <B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">not</B> on-site at any Authorized Location) to the designated EncounterPRO specialist in my practice or organization (and/or the network administrator hired by me and deemed qualified by JMJ to assist with and implement such support) for only the current, commercially released version of EncounterPRO (and versions of EncounterPRO that have not been superseded by a newer release within the six months prior to the date each such request for support <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>is made).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Such support shall be provided during JMJ’s normal support hours, <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:time w:st="on" Hour="7" Minute="0">7 a.m.</st1:time> through <st1:time w:st="on" Hour="19" Minute="0">7 p.m.</st1:time>, <st1:place w:st="on">Eastern U.S.</st1:place> time, Monday through Friday, except federal holidays.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In addition, JMJ shall staff a support hotline for after-hours and weekend requests that are Urgent (as defined below).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>An EncounterPRO support specialist will respond within four (4) business hours to any request concerning a problem that renders the use of EncounterPRO impossible or impractical at most or all workstations at an Authorized Location (an “Urgent” request).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>An EncounterPRO support specialist will respond to requests that are not Urgent in as expeditious a manner as is practical, but shall not devote attention to such requests at the expense of Urgent requests.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>User and JMJ agree to cooperate with one another and with qualified, competent third party contractors of either party to solve support incidents that affect User’s use of the Software.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If an EncounterPRO support specialist determines that one or more upgrades or other modifications to one or more components of the Software or User’s infrastructure is the next logical step to attempt to cure or alleviate a problem that is the subject of a support incident, JMJ personnel and EncounterPRO support specialists may discontinue efforts to develop or evaluate alternative solutions if User refuses to perform or authorize a third party to perform (in the case of upgrades or modifications to User’s infrastructure or other software or components other the Software) or to authorize the EncounterPRO support specialist to perform (in the case of the Software) such upgrade or modification and such refusal is, in the judgment of JMJ’s Manager of Support Services (or equivalent manager performing such duties) unreasonable.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Efforts expended by one or more EncounterPRO support specialists to determine the cause of a problem that affects the use of EncounterPRO or Supplier Software shall be covered by the annual support fee and shall not be chargeable to User on an hourly basis until after the point at which an EncounterPRO support specialist has determined with reasonable certainty that the problem was not caused by any defect or error in EncounterPRO or the Supplier Software <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unless</I> User or User’s agent withheld information needed to make such an assessment or declined to cooperate in reaching such an assessment.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Neither JMJ nor the Authorized Distributor is obligated, under this <st1:stockticker w:st="on">CAA</st1:stockticker> or any subsequent course of dealing, to provide support services (including, for example, reinstallations of EncounterPRO, efforts to move one or more databases to a different server or servers, or efforts to recover data) at no additional cost to User beyond the annual support fee where the need for such support is precipitated not by any defect or error in EncounterPRO or any Supplier Software (which includes supported interfaces to, for example, medical devices, practice management systems and laboratories), but is instead precipitated by a “Non-EncounterPRO Issue.” A “Non-EncounterPRO Issue” is defined as: (i) a change or upgrade to hardware, network infrastructure, communications equipment or software, operating systems or other software that is not EncounterPRO or Supplier Software; (ii) one or more failures of such components other than EncounterPRO or Supplier Software; (iii) the attempted use of EncounterPRO or Supplier Software with hardware, devices, drivers or other software that are not certified by JMJ as appropriate for use with EncounterPRO or the Supplier Software; (iv) the errors or lack of expertise of User’s network administrator or others to whom User has intentionally or negligently allowed access to User’s network; or (v) User’s failure to maintain system security and integrity.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Where the need for support services is precipitated by one or more Non-EncounterPRO Issues, JMJ and the Authorized Distributor reserve the right to decline to assist to correct such problems unless User agrees to pay for such services on an hourly fee basis.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Upgrades of EncounterPRO and/or Supplier Software during JMJ’s normal support hours shall be deemed routine and included in the cost of annual support and upgrades.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Upgrades of EncounterPRO and/or Supplier Software that are otherwise routine but which User requests be performed outside JMJ’s normal support hours shall be billed at a premium of up to 150% of JMJ’s normal hourly rates for similar work performed during normal business hours.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Efforts undertaken by EncounterPRO support specialists or JMJ personnel that are not precipitated by an error or defect in EncounterPRO or the Supplier Software but are instead precipitated by one or more Non-EncounterPRO Issues shall be billed to User at JMJ’s normal hourly rates for such work where such work is performed during JMJ’s normal support hours.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Such work described in the foregoing sentence that is performed by EncounterPRO support specialists or JMJ personnel at times other than JMJ’s normal support hours (that is, nights, weekends and holidays) shall be billed at a premium of up to 150% of the normal hourly rates; moreover, all such efforts shall be billed and no such efforts shall be deemed complimentary.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>JMJ reserves the right to respond only to those inquires or requests made by the designated EncounterPRO specialist in my practice or organization and/or the network administrator hired by me and deemed qualified by JMJ to assist with and implement such support or the designated alternates (if any) in those roles.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If these individuals are not present at the Authorized Location that is experiencing the problem and are not otherwise available at the time that application support is requested, then JMJ will respond to any person at the Authorized Location that seeks assistance.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I understand that users of EncounterPRO that are not adequately trained should not rely upon JMJ’s support desk for training.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The practice may purchase training services for such users, encourage them to seek help from experienced users at the practice, or encourage them to consult the Users’ Manual, other documentation available from the JMJ website or user bulletin board, or online help screens.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I further understand that additional training (whether remote or on-site) of either new users or experienced users is not included in the annual support fee; such additional training is available and will be billed on an hourly basis, or other basis agreed upon prior to such training.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
