<h1>Performance Monitoring</h1><h2>10443</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A practice calls regarding issues of slowness in EncounterPro. Or Slowness Overall.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Delays between screens in EncounterPro Or General Epro Slowness</p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>Performance -</P><P>1. What is slow?</P><P>a) We need to isolate the specificc times of slowness in seconds-ex. how long does it take to go from screen to screen</P><P>b)&nbsp; Please review this document&nbsp; to see Average Seconds per Page - &nbsp;http:\\underconstruction-jennyycreate</P><P>2. Forget about Epro, and focus on the system.</P><P>a)Elimnate Epro, and&nbsp; Eliminate other programs. -ex.&nbsp; Make sure their aren't print jobs stuck causing slowness or Maybe their are too many users logged into the system.</P><P>3.Check Task Manager</P><P>a)&nbsp; Look at CPU usage&nbsp; vs. Physical&nbsp;Capacity-&nbsp;</P><P>b) If the Cpu Usage&nbsp; exceeds 70% consistently, then you have a processor bottelneck</P><P>c) This is for the RAM-Look at Virtual &nbsp;Memory vs. Physical Memory- Virtual RAM should not exceed Physical RAM&nbsp;</P><P>c) Check the memory usage of the encounterpro services under the process tab- Total services should not exceed 1/2 a Gig.</P><P>d) 1.7 Gig will be the typical memory usage of SQL</P><P>- If SQL is under 1.7 Gigs, and RAM utilzation is exceeding physical RAM, then verify that SQL is set to Dynamic Memory</P><P>4. Running Performance Monitor</P><P>a) Always save your performance monitor profile with your intitals in case you ever need to go back.</P><P>b) After you start the performance monitor we are going to add counters for Memory, Processor, and Physical Disk</P><P>&nbsp;- Memory-</P><P>Pages per second should not exceed 200 pages per second</P><P>Memory Counters:</P><P>Pages Reads/sec</P><P>Pages Write/sec</P><P>-Processor-</P><P>The processor&nbsp; que length should not go above 2 or 3 consistently</P><P>Processor Counters:</P><P>%Idle Time</P><P>%Privilged TIme</P><P>%Processor time</P><P>- Physical Disk -</P><P>Average disk que length shoud not consistently exceeding&nbsp;1</P><P>Percent disk time should not go above 100</P><P>Note[disk defrag would cause the %disk time to spike up, and bad indexes would cause the read/write to also spike up]</P><P>Physical Disk Counters:</P><P>%Disk Time</P><P>Avg. DskQueue Length</P><P>Avg. Disk Read Queue Length</P><P>Avg. Disk Write Queue Length</P><P>Current Disk Queue Length</P><P>5. Terminal Sessions</P><P>50 user is the typical amount one would expect for&nbsp; for a dedicated server. 35 users is the typical amount for a non dedicated server. Anything&nbsp;over these amounts&nbsp;may&nbsp;cause performance problems.</P><P>6. The formula:</P><P>This is the formula&nbsp; for&nbsp; server requirements for a optimal system</P><P>OS:256 MB</P><P>SQL:1.7 Gigs</P><P>5 Services: 300 MB</P><P>Thin Clients: 70-80 MB each Max 20 users</P><P>Averge total RAM: 2 Gigs</P><P>If they have more than 40 Users, then 4 Gigs</P><P>Minimum- 20% Free Disk space all the time</P><P>3 times the size of sql database needed in&nbsp; Disk Space</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>7.Traces</P><P>When doing traces focus on durations and and reads. Look at the time it takes to do specific tasks.&nbsp; Also look at how many records per minutes. </P><P>15 records per minute denotes a possible problem.&nbsp; Over 100 records per minute is a definite problem.</P><P>If you have High Durations and High Reads then you needto do a &nbsp;rebuild</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Note[Daily Reboot not a bad thing, suggested weekly reboot]</P><P align=right>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
