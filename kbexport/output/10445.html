<h1>How to stop EP modifiers from billing automatically in Version 4.0</h1><h2>10445</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>Scripts were run against customer databases in the Fall of 2005.&nbsp; The purpose of the script was to automatically bill an EP modifier if certain procedures were ordered for Medicaid patients.&nbsp; The scripts that were run identified which authority ids had an authority category of 'Medicaid' in c_authority.&nbsp; For each authority_id with an authority_category of 'Medicaid,' the scripts added records in c_procedure_coding for CPT codes 99395, 99394, 99393, 99392, 99391, 99385, 99384, 99383, 99382, 99381, 99173, 99172, 96110, 92556, 92555, 92553, 92552, 92551, 90748, 90747, 90746, 90744, 90743, 90740, 90734, 90733, 90732, 90723, 90721, 90720, 90718, 90716, 90715, 90714, 90713, 90712, 90710, 90707, 90706, 90705, 90704, 90703, 90702, 90701, 90700, 90698, 90680, 90675, 90669, 90660, 90658, 90657, 90656, 90655, 90648, 90647, 90646, 90645, 90636, 90634, 90633, 90632, 90586, 90585, 90472, 90471, 90378, 90371, 86850, 86585, 86580, 83655.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>An EP modifier bills automatically when certain procedures are selected for patients with certain insurance companies (usually a Medicaid company).</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>Automatic billing of EP modifiers occurs when records have been inserted in the c_procedure_coding table.&nbsp; </P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>Add the letters "qzq" (or another combination of improbable letters) to the authority id in c_procedure_coding.&nbsp; To add the letters to every record you can run the following sequel query.&nbsp; Deleting these records is also an option but is not as easily reversed if the customer changes his mind as to some or all of the cpt codes and/or authority ids.&nbsp; </P><P>UPDATE c_procedure_coding</P><P>SET authority_id = authority_id&nbsp;+ 'qzq'</P><P>WHERE </P><P>cpt_code IN ('99395', '99394', '99393', '99392', '99391', '99385', '99384', '99383', '99382', '99381', '99173', '99172', '96110', '92556', '92555', '92553', '92552', '92551', '90748', '90747', '90746', '90744', '90743', '90740', '90734', '90733', '90732', '90723', '90721', '90720', '90718', '90716', '90715', '90714', '90713', '90712', '90710', '90707', '90706', '90705', '90704', '90703', '90702', '90701', '90700', '90698', '90680', '90675', '90669', '90660', '90658', '90657', '90656', '90655', '90648', '90647', '90646', '90645', '90636', '90634', '90633', '90632', '90586', '90585', '90472', '90471', '90378', '90371', '86850', '86585', '86580', '83655')</P><P>AND modifier = 'EP'</P><P>GO</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>We need an interface so that the customer can set up billing rules for certain insurance companies and procedures.&nbsp;</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
