<h1>Edit-Refill prescriprion prints wrong provider signature</h1><h2>10467</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When the user selects &lt;Edit-Refill&gt; on the treatment dashboard and after finishing the edits and the refill they print the prescription, the original provider still prints on the prescription.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>The "Edit" part of the &lt;Edit-Refill&gt; workplan creates a new treatment and closes the old treatment with a status of "Modified".&nbsp; The treatment dashboard knows how to display and work with the latest treatment, but since the &lt;Edit-Refill&gt; workplan never returns to the treatment dashboard before opening the refill screen, the refill progress note is actually applied to the original treatment and not to the new, modified treatment.&nbsp; When the new modified treatment is then printed, the prescription report doesn't see the refill progress note so it reverts back to the original ordering provider.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>Apply Hotfix 106</P><P>Hotfix 106 updates a stored procedure which will make sure the Refill progress note gets applied to the correct treatment.&nbsp; Hotfix 106 also repairs previous refills by re-applying them to the correct treatment.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This problem is resolved in DB Mod level 127.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
