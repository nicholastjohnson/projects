<h1>Patients by same name cannot be checked into same exam room</h1><h2>10500</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>this article explains how to resolve patients by same name and not&nbsp;able checked into same exam room</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><FONT size=2><P>two patients by the same name and one of them vanished while checking into exam room. but showing two service bars to take vitals</P></FONT></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>It's because EncoutnerPRO supress the duplciate bar names on the left side. If two of the patients you are checking in has the same first name and last name then it'll supress one patient bar. </P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>Build 35 address this little differently. it includes the name and age on the patient bar and so this should be resolved with 35. In case if the patients are twins and has the same first name and last name then it might be the same problem again. In that case we might include Nick names in the service bars to avoid those situations in future builds. I hope the fix implemented in 35 (name and age) should be fine now.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
