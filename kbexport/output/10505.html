<h1>How to fix an invalid observation mapping that causes results to post to a wrong lab</h1><h2>10505</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>this article explains how to fix invalid-observation mapping that is built during manual posting.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>lab results are showing under wrong lab observations. for example posting a urine culture shows&nbsp;under cbc in encounterpro.</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>originally when the user manually established a relationship between lab vendor observation to an encounterpro observation they failed to pay attention before picking a treatment from post treatment screen.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>go to the treatment dashboard for those invalid observations and then click "Un-Do Mapping" button (under other options). this basically removes the mapping built in for that lab observation (both valid and invalid links are deleted from our translation table). so the user has to manually map this lab once again when a next result message received for that lab observation.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
