<h1>unable to create new diagnosis or procedure if the ICD or CPT code already exists</h1><h2>10507</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>a) unable to create new diagnosis if the ICD9 code already exists.</P><P>b) unable to create new procedure if the&nbsp;CPT code already exists.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>When a new diagnosis or procedure is created, EncounterPRO will check to see if a diagnosis or procedure with the same description and code already exists.&nbsp; If so, then the existing diagnosis or procedure will be used instead of creating a new one.&nbsp; These stored procedures were enhanced as part of improvements to the v2 to v4 Migratino process to include a check to see if the code alone already exists.&nbsp; While this is the desire behavior for migrations, it is not the desired behavior for the EncounterPRO client.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>Hotfix # 65, which made the original migration enhancements, has been updated to include logic to allow the EncounterPRO client to create assessments and procedures where the icd or cpt already exists, as long as the description is different from the existing assessment or procedure.</P><P>Apply or Re-Apply Hotfix 65</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>This problem is reported as DevIssue # 6839 and is permanently resolved as part of Mod Level 127.&nbsp; The changes to the stored procedures may be applied to a Mod Level 126 database by applying Hotfix # 65.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
