When the lab is downloaded it is replacing the pt's office ID# with pt's SSN</strong><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">- <em>Epro Lab results engine never updates the patient record and so this is not possible.</em></font></font></p><font size="2"></font><p><font size="3"><strong>2. Some of the labs that were listed as being sent to LabCorp aren't downloading and I'm just getting the results off my LabCorp printer</strong><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">- <em>Need specific examples to troubleshoot.</em></font></font></p><font size="2"></font><p><font size="3"><strong>3. One of the first patients I did has all his lab results listed under ONE lab test instead of dividing them up under the correct lab</strong><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> </strong></font></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>-</strong> A result message contains results for one or more labs ordered. But epro engine attempts to spilt them as individul results and automatically (or manually) selects the right treatment in order to post the results. There is no way two differnt lab order results posted to single lab treatment unless the user accidently selects the same treatment for posting different lab results.</em></font></p><font size="2"></font><p><font size="3"><strong>4. One of the patients name is misspelled by LabCorp so unsure if it will post</strong><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>- Right now the epro lab results engine looks up the patient by our internal billing id or lab vendor id. So the misspelled names should not be an issue.</em></font></font></p><font size="2"></font><p><font size="3"><strong>5. I posted a results to treatment but no message was sent to the doctor to make him aware that the results were back even though the results were in the patient's chart</strong><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> </strong></font></font></p><p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>- Once a result is posted it automatically generates a 'TODO' item and puts them in doctors todo list for reveiw. If not then notify our 'Config' team to look into this.</em></font></font></p><font size="2"><p><strong><font size="3">6. What do I do if I accidently delete a results instead of posting it?</font></strong> </p><p><em>- Request JMJ support for those deleted patients (with date the result was received) to resend them again.</em></p></font></p>
