<h1>Immunization dose schedule for VaxTrax</h1><h2>10519</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article describes the configuration and updating of the c_immunization_dose_schedule table.&nbsp;</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>The c_immunization_dose_schedule table is automatically&nbsp;populated with EncounterPRO upgrades.&nbsp; As configured by JMJ Technologies, Inc., the scheduling rules set forth in this table comply with the 2006&nbsp;standard&nbsp;set forth by&nbsp;the Center for Disease Control (CDC).&nbsp; See <A href="http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/child-schedule.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/child-schedule.htm</A>.</P><P>Values in this table can be manually reconfigured.&nbsp; They can also be deleted to allow the user to create his or her own vaccination rules through the user interface.&nbsp; (This is not recommended as it may result in non-compliance with CDC standards.)</P><P>The columns of the c_immunization_dose_schedule table are as follows:</P><P>disease_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disease id is defined in c_disease.&nbsp; Each disease that is prevented by a given vaccine needs to be defined in terms of a disease id.&nbsp; Currently,&nbsp;vaccines are scheduled for&nbsp;the following diseases:&nbsp; Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, HIB, Polio, HepA, HepB, Varicella, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Influenza, Menningococcus, and Pneumococcus.</P><P>dose_schedule_sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each disease id must be linked to one or more dose_schedule_sequence ids.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dose_schedule_sequence numbers&nbsp;identify the&nbsp;dosing rule(s) for for a particular dose&nbsp;sequence&nbsp;within a series of doses.&nbsp; For example, if there are two different dosing rules that might apply to the third dose of a DTaP, each of those two different rules will be identified by a unique&nbsp;dose_schedule_sequence id.&nbsp; </P><P>dose_number&nbsp;&nbsp; The dose_number specifies the dose sequence within a series of doses to which the dose_schedule_sequence id pertains.&nbsp; For example, if there are two different dosing rules that might apply to the third dose of a DTaP, there will be two unique dose_schedule_sequence ids, each of which will&nbsp;be associated with&nbsp;a dose_number of "3."</P><P>patient_age_range_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient_age_range_id is defined in the c_age_range and c_age_range_category tables.&nbsp; The age_range_category "Immunization" and its constituent age_range_ids&nbsp;should be used in configuring the patient_age_range_id.&nbsp; The patient_age_range_id specifies the age range during which the a particular shot (defined by a disease_id, dose_schedule_sequence, and dose_number) may be administered.&nbsp; </P><P>first_dose_age_range_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This id is derived from the "Immunization" age_range_category in the c_age_range table.&nbsp; It defines the minimum age at which a particular shot (defined by a disease_id, dose_schedule_sequence, and dose_number) may be given.&nbsp; </P><P>last_dose_age_range_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This id is derived from the Immunization age_range_category in the c_age_range table.&nbsp; It defines the maximum age at which a particular shot (defined by a disease_id, dose_schedule_sequence, and dose_number) may be given.&nbsp; </P><P>last_dose_interval_amount&nbsp;/ last_dose_interval_unit_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two values define the minimum amount of time that should elapse&nbsp;between the time that the patient was given his or her most recent dose of a vaccine&nbsp;(defined by the dose number)&nbsp;and the next dose of the vaccine&nbsp;that is due.&nbsp; </P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
