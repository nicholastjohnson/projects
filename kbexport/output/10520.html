<h1>How to create an age-based treatment workplan</h1><h2>10520</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article explains how to create an age-based and/or gender-based&nbsp;patient workplan.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Sometimes, it is desireable to prompt the user to ask specific questions or to review certain clinical guidelines based on the age and/or gender of the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;A quintessential example of this are the Anticipatory Guidance templates for pediatrics and the Bright Futures physician guidelines and patient materials developed for pediatricians.&nbsp; All three of these (age-based templates, age-based phyiscian guidelines, and age-based patient materials) can be accomplished by configuring age-based&nbsp;patient workplans.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>A patient workplan is a user-defined&nbsp;sequence of user-defined screens, each of which can be driven by user-defined criteria.&nbsp; The following describes how&nbsp;EncounterPRO's age-based&nbsp;Anticipatory Guidance screens have been configured and how these screens have been linked to buttons that display and print age-based physician guidelines and age-based patient materials.&nbsp; </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Age-Based / Gender-Based Templates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>The first step in creating an age-based patient workplan that brings up age-appropriate templates is to configure the templates themselves.&nbsp; The configuration of templates is covered in the EPRO Configuration Manual.</P><P>The second step (after creating the individual templates) is to&nbsp;create a patient workplan that will be linked to each of the age-based templates.&nbsp; To create a patient workplan, select the "Configuration" tab, then select "Workplans."&nbsp; Select the "New Workplan" button and enter a description of the new workplan.&nbsp; On the "Workplan Definition" screen that appears, click on the "Add Step" button.&nbsp; Type in a description of the Workplan step or use the default description and select "OK."&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>On the "Workplan Step Definition" screen that appears, click on the "Add Treatment" button.&nbsp; Select the desired Treatment Type (such as Anticipatory Guidance) and select one of the age based templates that you have&nbsp;configured.&nbsp; Repeat this step for all of the age-based templates that you have configured so that all of the templates have been added as treatments to the workplan step.&nbsp; </P><P>Now, click on each treatment and select the "Edit Criteria" button.&nbsp; Select the desired gender and age range for each workplan step.&nbsp; Click on each treatment and select the "Ordered For" button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the "Ordered For" to "Workplan Owner."&nbsp; Click on each treatment and select the "Edit Flags" button.&nbsp; Set each "Perform Immediately" flag to "Yes."&nbsp; </P><P>Once an age-based patient workplan has been created to display an age-based template, the workplan itself can be included in a&nbsp;user-defined&nbsp;Encounter Workplan or in a user-defined button.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are also user-defined preferences called "Custom Favorite Child Anticipatory Guidance Workplan (QVV Nurse)" and "Custom Favorite Child Anticipatory Guidance Workplan (Button)" that can be used to insert&nbsp;any newly-created patient workplan into existing Encounter Workplans and buttons.&nbsp; </P><P>Age-Based / Gender-Based Patient Materials</P><P>One configuration tool that can be used to create printed age-based and/or gender-based Patient Materials is to create&nbsp;"Education Materials"&nbsp;treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Education Materials" can be created by clicking on&nbsp;the "Configurations" tab, clicking on "Education&nbsp;Materials" and&nbsp;&nbsp;linking&nbsp;an image, a&nbsp;document file, or a URL&nbsp;to an Education Materials treatment.&nbsp; Once all of the age-based&nbsp;and/or gender-based&nbsp;Education Materials treatments have been created, they can be linked into an age-based treatment&nbsp;workplan using the procedures described above.&nbsp; </P><P>Age-Based / Gender-based Physician Guidelines</P><P>Physician guidelines may be configured as Education Materials in the same manner as Patient Materials.&nbsp; (Select the "Configurations" tab, click&nbsp;on "Education&nbsp;Materials,"&nbsp;then&nbsp;&nbsp;link&nbsp;an image, document file, or URL&nbsp;to an Education Materials treatment.&nbsp; When creating the patient workplan, follow the instructions above but use the "Add Service" button rather than the "Add Treatment" button.&nbsp; Select the Service "Education Materials" then select all of the age-based and/or gender-based Education Materials treatments that you wish to link to the workplan.&nbsp; Follow the procedures described above to set the appropriate&nbsp;"Edit Criteria," "Ordered For" and "Edit Flags" values for each Education Materials treatment.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
