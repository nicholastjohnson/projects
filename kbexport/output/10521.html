<h1>How reference materials are linked to Assessments and updated by JMJ Technologies</h1><h2>10521</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>This article explains how reference materials are linked to Assessments and how they are automatically updated by JMJ Technologies, Inc.&nbsp; </P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>If the user has the need to view physician guidelines or to view patient reference materials while developing a treatment plan for an Assessment, he or she can view those materials by selecting the "References" tab on the Assessment Treatment screen.&nbsp; Because every Assessment in EncounterPRO has its own configurable Assessment Treatment screen, the references on each Assessment Treatment screen can be configured to be specific to each Assessment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>EncounterPRO Version 5.0 and above allows the user to link&nbsp;Reference Materials (both Patient Reference Materials and Provider Reference Materials) to&nbsp;the Assessment Treatment Screen for each Assessment in the EncounterPRO database.&nbsp; JMJ Technologies Inc. will populate the Patient Reference Materials and the Provider Reference Materials field with new reference links when the user is upgraded to 5.0 or above.&nbsp; There is also a user interface for each site to customize these reference links.&nbsp; </P><P>The following describes the procedure for selecting Patient and Provider Reference Materials associated with each Assessment.&nbsp; </P><P>The first step is to create a Reference Material treatment that can be linked to an Assessment.&nbsp; A Reference Material treatment can&nbsp;be linked&nbsp;either to a&nbsp;file or to a URL.&nbsp; So, for example, if the user has a favorite patient hand-out for Otitis&nbsp;that is a Microsoft Word document or a pdf file, he/she can create a Reference Material treatment called "Otitis patient education" and can link that treatment to the desired file.&nbsp; Alternatively, if the user likes the Department of Health and Human Services'&nbsp;protocols for the treatment of GERD, he/she can create a Reference Material called "GERD physician protocols" and link the treatment to DHHS' URL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><P>Once a Reference Material has been&nbsp;created, it is linked to an Assessment in the following manner:</P><P>Click on the "Configuration" tab.&nbsp; Select "Assessments."&nbsp; Select the Assessment for which you desire to designate specific Patient or Provider Reference Materials.&nbsp; Click on "Edit Assessment."&nbsp; Click on the "Patient Reference Material" bar or the "Provider Reference Material" bar.&nbsp; Select the Reference Material that you wish to associate with the Assessment you are configuring.</P><P>To view the Reference materials, go into a patient file.&nbsp; Click on an assessment for that patient.&nbsp; Select the "References" tab and view the Reference materials associated with that assessment.&nbsp; </P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
