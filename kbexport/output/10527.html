<h1>Permission Denied</h1><h2>10527</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>Some aspect of EncounterPRO is behaving incorrectly and an error message like this one appears in the error log:</P><P><FONT color=#000080 size=2>EXECUTE permission denied on object xxxxxxxx</FONT></P><P><FONT color=#000080 size=2>&nbsp;</P></FONT></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>To prevent unauthorized access to patients' confidential medical records, the EncounterPRO database has only the minimum permissions granted on the tables and stored procedures.&nbsp; Furthermore, these permissions are granted to an application role and not a direct SQL user.&nbsp; If any permission is missing for any reason, EncounterPRO will behave incorrectly and report "permission denied" SQL errors.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>The correct permissions on all EncounterPRO database objects are stored in a file on the FTP site.&nbsp; Execute this file in the SQL Query Analyzer using an account that has DBO privileges.</P><P>EP_Quick_Fixes\Permissions CPRSystem 126.sql</P><P>Don't worry if the database is not on mod level 126 yet.&nbsp; Regardless of the mod level, the query analyzer is likely to report a number of errors running this script like the one below.&nbsp; These errors are OK and can be ignored.</P><P>Server: Msg 208, Level 16, State 11, Line 2<BR>Invalid object name 'dbo.xxxxxxxxxxxx'.<BR></P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
