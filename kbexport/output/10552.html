<h1>Users Conference Registration</h1><h2>10552</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article describes the webpage where users can register for the 2006 EncounterPRO EHR Users Conference. This page was written using MS Visual Stuido 2005. It is comprised of these files: <br><ul><li>Default.aspx</li><li>Registration.aspx</li><li>Completion.aspx</li><li>AuthenticationFailed.htm</li><li>(a key file from Cybersource)</li><li>(a config file)<br></li></ul></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>The link for this page is here:<br>https://www.jmjtech.com/UserConferenceRegistration/Default.aspx<br><br>This page prompts the user for their customer ID and password (and tells how to find it if they don't know it).<br>The next page is the Registration Form. It is divided up into 3 parts:<br>1- Practice Information<br>2- Attendee Registration<br>3- Payment Information<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><h3>Practice Information</h3>These fields are required:<br><ul><li>                    Address line 1                                        </li><li>                    Country</li><li>City</li><li>State *<br></li><li>Zip *<span id="RegularExpressionValidator1" style="color: Red; visibility: hidden;"></span></li><li>Phone<span id="RegularExpressionValidator2" style="color: Red; visibility: hidden;">*</span></li><li>Fax</li><li>Contact</li><li>Email<span id="RegularExpressionValidator3" style="color: Red; visibility: hidden;">*</span></li></ul>* not required if Contry is not USA<h3>Attendee Registration</h3>At least one attendee is required. The Subtotals and Grand Total automatically calcuate when an attendee is added  or removed, and when options are added or removed.<br><br><h3>Payment Information</h3>All fields in this section (except "<span id="Label5">Address line 2</span>") are required unless the billing address is the same as the practice address.<br><br>When the user has filled out all the necessary fields correctly and clicks Submit, the page will redirect to a confirmation page with the details of the user's order. (If not all necessary fields are filled out, or not all necessary fields are filled out correctly, errors will display at the top of the screen with reasons why the order did not go thru.) When an order is successfully submitted, a record of the order and the details of the attendees is stored on a local database. (The customer's credit card number is not stored on any local database.) Then the order's details are sent (via secure transmission) to a payment processing partner, Cybersource. <br>When the order is successfully received by Cybersource, the order has a status of Pending in our database while Cybersource holds on to the order for batched transactions. The changing of the status of the order on our local database from Pending to Complete must be done manually as Cybersource provides no method for notification of successful batch processing in their Simple Order API.<br></p>
