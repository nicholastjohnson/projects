<h1>Duplicate History Results After Migration</h1><h2>10554</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>After a Version 2 to Version 4 migration, the history screens (e.g. Review PFSH) show duplicate history results.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This&nbsp;can be&nbsp;caused when the migration scripts are re-run for any reason.&nbsp; The scripts will usually detect data that has already been migrated and not re-migrate it, but in the case of histories the data is sometimes re-migrated producing duplicates.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>A utility script called&nbsp;"Fix v2 to v4 Duplicate Histories.sql" will detect and disable the duplicates.&nbsp; Run the script from the Utility tab of the DBMaintenance program.</P><P>THIS UTILITY SCRIPT WILL LOCK UP THE DATABASE FOR UP TO 1 HOUR.&nbsp; DO NOT RUN THIS UTILITY SCRIPT WHILE USERS ARE USING ENCOUNTERPRO.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
