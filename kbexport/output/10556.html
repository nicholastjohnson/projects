<h1>Missing patient attachments</h1><h2>10556</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article explains the purpose of, and how to get and use the Missing Patient Attachments utility.<br><br><h3>Purpose</h3>This program will list all results of a query of patients whose attachments may be misplaced or lost. It will then show the number of patients whose attachments were misplaced but are now fixed. It will also show the patients whose attachments could not be found.<br><br><h3>How to Get</h3><p>This program can be found here:<br><a href="ftp://ftp.jmjtech.com/JMJSupport/SupportTools/mpa.zip">ftp://ftp.jmjtech.com/JMJSupport/SupportTools/mpa.zip</a></p><p>Unzip the files onto the local computer's hard drive.&nbsp; If you unzip the files into an EncounterPRO program directory, you may use a parameter to specify the EncounterPRO database (see below).</p><p><strong>How to Use</strong></p><p>Run this program by double clicking on it or running it from a command line.&nbsp; If you run it from a command line, you may supply a parameter as follows:</p><p>mpa.exe [label]<br><br>Where label is the name of the database link shown on the ASK screen. For example, in this case:<br><img alt="example of a label" src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10556/10556-a.bmp"><br>the label would be Beta-Dellserv, not cpr_405_beta. <br>So in this case the program might be run like so:<br>mpa.exe Markdev<br><br>When the interface comes up, click “Verify/Repair Files”.<br><br>If the program is run with a valid paramter and in a folder where EncounterPRO.ini exists, it will use the label in that file. Otherwise, if no label is given or the label is invalid, you will be prompted for the server and database name.</p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>When run, this is what the program looks like:<br><img alt="example of mpa.exe" src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10556/10556-b.bmp"><br></p>
