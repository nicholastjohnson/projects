<h1>Vaccine Status not Updating According to Schedule AKA MMR problem</h1><h2>10571</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>When you update a vaccine/disease schedule you have to be very careful that the dose numbering is consecutive (1,2,3 etc.) If you delete a middle step, the others DO NOT renumber. This leads to the vaccine status not updating correctly. For example, if the child has received 1 MMR shot at 12 months according to the schedule and Measles and Rubella show up as overdue, but Mumps is not -- check the disease schedule for Measles and Rubella. The schedule may look the same (ages, warning dates, etc.) but if the step numbers are not consecutive (1 then 3), the system thinks that the child is missing a shot.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P><IMG alt="screen shot" hspace=0 src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10571/temp2.bmp" align=baseline border=0></P><P><IMG alt="screen capture" hspace=0 src="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/images/10571/temp.bmp" align=baseline border=0></P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>Go into the Config&gt;Vaccines/Diseases</P><P>Select the disease, then the Schedule button.
