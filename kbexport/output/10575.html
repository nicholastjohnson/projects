<h1>How to share folders with Unix</h1><h2>10575</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>Some EncounterPRO Practice Management Integrations require EncounterPRO to share files with a Unix computer.&nbsp; There are a number of products which make this possible by either sharing folders on the Unix computer which can be accessed from Windows, or by sharing folders on the Windows computer which can be accessed by Unix.&nbsp; Any of these solutions will work and the system manager/integrator simply needs to insure that the appropriate software is installed and configured properly, and that the folders needed for the integration are shared properly and have the appropriate permissions set.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>Our preferred product for sharing folders with a Unix computer is NFS Server from XLink Technologies, Inc.</P><P>This product can be purchased from here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<A href="http://www.xlink.com">http://www.xlink.com</A></P><P>The latest installation file can probably be found on the JMJ FTP Site under&nbsp;EP_SupportingInstallers\Xlink, however it will require a serial number and password when it is installed that can only be acquired by purchasing a license.</P><P>Instructions for&nbsp;configuring NFS Server can be found here:&nbsp; <A href="http://www.xlink.com/S-server2k.html">http://www.xlink.com/S-server2k.html</A>&nbsp; See the section labeled "Export drives and folders for NFS sharing"</P><P>Other support options, including free phone or email technical support can be found here:&nbsp; <A href="http://www.xlink.com/support.htm">http://www.xlink.com/support.htm</A></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
