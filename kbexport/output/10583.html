<h1>Changing Menu on SOAP Chart Summary Rev tab</h1><h2>10583</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>The&nbsp;Rev or Summary (Sigma) tab on the SOAP screen has a menu that you can update, but the menu name doesn't appear even when you are in Configuration mode. </P><P>The menu is controlled by a Preference: User-Defined &gt; Special Favorite Child/Adult Chart Menu Summary.</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>1. Locate the Preference in the preferences list. There is a preference for Child and another for Adult. You should probably change both.</P><P>2. Select the Preference &gt; Special Favorite Child/Adult Chart Menu Summary&nbsp; and note the menu name. (Generally this will be: Standard Chart Menu Summary Screen Default and Standard Chart Menu Summary Screen Default&nbsp;Child)&nbsp;You could change the entire menu here at the preference, but if you just want to add/remove from the current menu you will need to do that via the Edit button.</P><P>3.&nbsp;BE SURE THAT YOU CHECK THE HIGHER PREFERENCE LEVELS! If there is a preference set at the Office, Specialty, or User level those will override the Global preference. Be sure you are editing the menu at the highest preference level. Highest level is User, lowest level is Global.</P><P>4. Select the Edit button under the menu name on the preference. Add/remove buttons as needed.</P><P>5. Restart EncounterPRO.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
