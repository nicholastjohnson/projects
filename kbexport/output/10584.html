<h1>Chart Export service does not appear to export all encounters</h1><h2>10584</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>When the chart export service is run, some of the encounters appear to be missing.&nbsp; In particular, when there are multiple encounters on the same day, only one of the encounters for that day appears to have been exported.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>This problem was caused by the naming convention used to save the exported encounter documents.&nbsp; When the first encounter for a particular day was exported, the document was saved with the encounter date, not including the time, embedded in the document file name.&nbsp; When the next encounter for the same date was exported, it would be given the same document name and would overwrite the first encounter document.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>There is a SQL script which will identify all of the Chart Export services performed where the patient had multiple encounters on the same day.&nbsp; The output of this query can be used to identify patients and encounters that might have been missing from pervious chart exports.&nbsp; Once identified, the desired encounter reports may be manually created and/or printed.</P><P>The script may be found here: </P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in -84pt 0pt 0in"><A href="https://www.jmjtech.com/KB/support_scripts/version4/misc/Chart%20Exports%20Dup%20Encounter%20Date.sql">https://www.jmjtech.com/KB/support_scripts/version4/misc/Chart Exports Dup Encounter Date.sql</A></P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This problem was resolved in EncounterPRO Client version 4.34.24.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
