<h1>Installing and running the Multi Chart Export utility</h1><h2>10589</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article describes how to install and run the EncounterPRO Multi Chart Export service</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>The EncounterPRO Multi Chart Export service is a new service available with the EncounterPRO Client version 4.34.24 or later.&nbsp; In addition to the client version, some new database object must be installed.&nbsp; These objects are installed as port of Mod Level 127, but can also be added to Mod Level 126 by running Hotfixes 129 and&nbsp;130.&nbsp; When the database objects are installed, a menu item will automatically be added to the Utility tab for running the Multi Chart Export service.</P><P>The hotfixes automatically install the buttons (one for the single chart export service on the Patient Demographics screen, and one for the multi chart export service on the Utilities screen).&nbsp; The multi chart export service simply calls the single chart export service over and over.&nbsp; The actual reports created are therefore controlled by the single chart export configuration.&nbsp; When the&nbsp; services are first installed (either by upgrading to Mod Level 127 or&nbsp;by running the hotfixes), the single chart export service is configured to run a “reasonable” set of reports to export the chart.&nbsp; If, however, the customer wants different or additional reports to be run as part of the chart export service, they must be configured according to <A href="https://www.jmjtech.com/kb/Article.aspx?ArticleNumber=10237">KB article 10237</A>.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
