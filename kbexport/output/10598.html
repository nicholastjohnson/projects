At this time the user is required to browse into the directory into which the files were exported and manually print the desired reports/attachments.</P><P>If the user wants to easily print all or multiple files, we have tested a 3rd party solution and find it useful, though we do not represent that it will print all attachments correctly. The product is called "Batch &amp; Print Pro" from Traction Software. Their web site is here:</P><P><A href="http://www.traction-software.co.uk/batchprint/index.html"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>http://www.traction-software.co.uk/batchprint/index.html</U></FONT></A></P><P>Once installed the user can drag entire directories into the program window and it will print all the files it finds in the same order they appear in the directory.</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
