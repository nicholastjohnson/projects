If the practice accidentally orders additional Initial OB Physicals, the results of the first Initial OB Physical will display if the later-ordered Initial OB Physicals are cancelled. If a later-ordered Initial OB Physical is blank, then the practice should simply cancel the physical. If a later-ordered Initial OB Physical has results, the practice should make sure that the results are entered in another physical exam template within the encounter before cancelling the later-ordered Initial OB Physical. At one practice, I created a copy of the Initial OB Physical and called it "Subsequent OB Physical." That way, if the practice wants to use a template that is similar to the Initial OB Physical later in the pregnancy, it can do so without affecting the display of the Initial OB Physical within the OB AP Report. </P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
