<h1>Numeric results not displaying in drilldown template</h1><h2>10603</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This article discusses one possible cause of the problem of numeric results not displaying in a drilldown template.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>The problem occurs when a numeric result is entered by the user but the result does not display when the user moves up in the template.</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>One cause of the problem is a null display style for the parent of the observation in which the numeric result is entered.&nbsp; For example, if a numeric result is entered within a simple observation called "HCT" and the observation "HCT" is the child of a parent observation called "CBC Results" and there is no display style set for "CBC Results," the numeric results of "HCT" will not display in the Lab template.&nbsp; </P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><P>If the parent of an observation with numeric results is lacking a display style, edit the parent observation and add a display style.&nbsp; A good default display style is "OBO|RRR|CRN."&nbsp; (Be sure to use bars (shift + backslash)&nbsp;instead of slashes when you enter the display style as slashes will also cause display problems.)</P></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
