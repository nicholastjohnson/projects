<h1>New Patients Coming into EncounterPRO from Billing System as Established  Established Patients Coming in as New</h1><h2>10610</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This article discusses how to fix the problem where a patient is checked into the Billing System (PMS) as a&nbsp;NEW or&nbsp;ESTABLISHED patient and comes through to EncounterPRO with the wrong&nbsp;NEW or&nbsp;ESTABLISHED primary visit code or the wrong&nbsp;NEW or&nbsp;ESTABLISHED encounter type.</SPAN></P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P>1.&nbsp; The patient is checked into the billing system and into EncounterPRO&nbsp;as a NEW patient and the E and M primary visit code in EncounterPRO is for an&nbsp;ESTABLISHED patient visit.&nbsp; Alternatively, the patient is checked into the billing system and into EncounterPRO&nbsp;as an ESTABLISHED patient and the E and M primary visit code in EncounterPRO is a NEW patient visit.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>2.&nbsp; The patient is checked into the billing system as a&nbsp;NEW or ESTABLISHED Patient and is coming through to EncounterPRO with the wrong encounter type.&nbsp; </P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; One&nbsp;common cause of this problem is that the new_flag has been improperly set in the b_appointment_type table.&nbsp; At some sites, there has been some confusion about the values that should be used for the new_flag column.&nbsp; The value "N" should be used if the appointment type is for an established patient.&nbsp; The value "Y" should be used if the appointment type is for a new patient.&nbsp; </P><P>At some sites, the value "E" has been used for established and the value "N" has been used for new.&nbsp; This is incorrect and will result in an improper mapping.</P><P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; A second common cause of the problem is an incorrect mapping between the appointment_type and the encounter_type in b_appointment_type.</P><P>a. In some instances, the incorrect mapping occurs because a NEW patient appointment type is mapped to an ESTABLISHED patient encounter type (or vice versa).</P><P>b.&nbsp; In other instances, separate&nbsp;appointment types for NEW and ESTABLISHED patients have not been set up in the billing system.&nbsp; A single appointment type is then mapped to an encounter type (NEW or ESTABLISHED)&nbsp;but there is no mapping to&nbsp;an encounter type with the alternate status.&nbsp; &nbsp;</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>1.&nbsp; In b_appointment_type, make sure that the new_flag is set to "Y" for NEW patient encounter types and to "N" for ESTABLISHED patient encounter types.&nbsp; "E" is not an accepted value in this table.&nbsp; </P><P>2.&nbsp; In b_appointment type, make sure that each appointment_type is properly mapped to the correct encounter_type and that there exists both a NEW and an ESTABLISHED appointment type in the billing system in any situation where the patient might be new or established.&nbsp; For example, the practice may never allow new patients to have a flu shot visit so in that case, there need only be an Established Patient flu shot visit appointment type in the billing system.&nbsp; However, if the practice sees both new and established patients for Sick Office Visits, there needs to be both a NEW patient sick visit appointment type&nbsp;and an ESTABLISHED patient sick visit appointment type set up in the billing system.&nbsp; </P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><P>To trouble-shoot this issue, ask for a patient/encounter example.&nbsp; If the billing system uses the x_encounterpro_arrived table, find the appointment_reason value and the new_flag value for that patient's encounter.&nbsp; The appointment_reason corresponds to appointment_type in b_appointment_type.&nbsp; The encounter_type value corresponds to the encounter_type in b_appointment_type.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new_flag corresponds to new_flag in b_appointment_type.&nbsp; </P><P>The x_encounterpro_arrived table pinpoints the precise mapping that is&nbsp;at issue&nbsp;in the encounter complained of by the customer.&nbsp; </P><P>For example, you may see in the x_encounterpro_arrived table that&nbsp;the patient has been checked into the billing system and into EncounterPRO with a New Patient visit type but that the new_flag is set to "N" indicating that the patient&nbsp;has been checked in as&nbsp;an established patient.&nbsp; In this instance, the likely cause of the problem is that the new_flag has been improperly set to "N" in the b_appointment type table and needs to be set to "Y."&nbsp; </P><P>Another example is that a customer may complain that established patients are coming into encounterpro with new patient encounter types.&nbsp; You may see in the x_encounterpro_arrived table that a patient has been checked into the billing system with an appointment_reason of "15" and an encounter_type of 'WELLNEW and a new_flag of "Y."&nbsp; If you ask the practice what "15" means in their billing system, they might tell you either that it is an Established Patient Well Visit or that it is a Well Visit and they don't distinguish between new and established patients in their billing system.&nbsp; In this instance there is an incorrect or incomplete mapping of appointment_type (Established Patient Well Visit)&nbsp;to encounter_type (New Patient Well Visit) with a new_flag of "Y."&nbsp; There needs to be an Established Patient Well Visit appointment_type that is mapped to a well visit encounter type with a new_flag of "N" and a New Patient Well Visit appointment type that is mapped to a well visit encounter type with a new_flag of "Y."&nbsp; </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The corollary to the example above is that a customer complains that new patients are coming into Encounterpro with established patient encounter types.&nbsp; You may see in the x_encounterpro_arrived table that a patient has been checked into the billing system with an appointment_reason of "16" and an encounter_type of 'WELL' and a new_flag of "N."&nbsp; If you ask the practice what "16" means in their billing system, they might tell you either that it is an&nbsp;New Patient Well Visit.&nbsp; In this instance there is an incorrect mapping of appointment_type (New Patient Well Visit)&nbsp;to encounter_type (Established Patient Well Visit) with a new_flag of "N."&nbsp; Again, there needs to be an Established Patient Well Visit appointment_type that is mapped to a well visit encounter type with a new_flag of "N" and a New Patient Well Visit appointment type that is mapped to a well visit encounter type with a new_flag of "Y."&nbsp; </P><P>&nbsp;</P></p>
