<h1>Auto Room Selection does not work with load balancing application servers</h1><h2>10623</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>EncounterPRO allows the users to configure the room a particular computer is physically located in.&nbsp; This configuration maps the computer id to a room id.&nbsp; When load balancing is used, the actual server that a thin client connects to will vary from session to session.&nbsp; Since the computer id for thin clients is a function of the application server and the windows user, the mapping from computer_id to room_id will only work if the application server selected for the windows session is the same as the application server used when the mapping was made.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>There is no workaround.&nbsp; Until a resolution is included in a future build of EncounterPRO, the auto-mapping of computers to rooms is unreliable in a load balancing environment.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This issue has been identified as Dev Issue # 7238 and is scheduled for resolution in EncounterPRO version 5.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
