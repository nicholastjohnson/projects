<h1>How to Configure the OB Antepartum Report</h1><h2>10629</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p><P>At the beginning of 2007, Mark created new tools for configuring and displaying information in the OB AP Report.&nbsp; These new tools are the Assessment Properties "WksG" and "EDD;" the "Assessment Observations" RTF Command and a new attribute for the Assessment Treatments RTF command (attached_treatments_only).</P></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>Two problems arise in the OB AP Report if these new tools are not used.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;the EGA and EDD&nbsp;calculations&nbsp;sometimes do not display.&nbsp; Second, the Report displays information from prior pregnancies.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cause</h3><p><P>The problems have two causes.&nbsp; First, the OB Report needs to have an Assessment Context so that data from prior (closed) pregnancies are not included in the Report for a current pregnancy.&nbsp; Prior to mid-2007, the OB AP report had a patient context.&nbsp; Instead, it needs to have an Assessment Context.</P><P>Second, the old properties used to calculate&nbsp;OB dates&nbsp;(Patient Properties EDD_LMP and&nbsp;EWG)&nbsp;do not always work because they have Patient contexts rather than Assessment contexts.&nbsp; The new Assessment properties (WksG and EDD) are superior.</P></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><P>The first thing to do is to go to DB Maintenance and select "Check Now."&nbsp; This step will automatically add the SQL&nbsp;properties needed to configure OB AP Reports.&nbsp; The second thing is to make sure that Hotfix 143 has been run.</P><P>Once the above preliminaries have been completed, the&nbsp;OB AP Report needs to be configured as an Assessment Report.&nbsp; Within the OB AP Report, the RTF Command "Assessment Observations" needs to be used in lieu of the "Patient Observations" Command.&nbsp; In addition, in some instances, the Patient Treatments RTF command needs to be replaced with the Assessment Treatments command.&nbsp; When the Assessment Treatments command is used, the "attached_treatments_only" attribute should be set to "No."&nbsp; </P><P>The OB AP Report needs to be painted on the OB Assessment Dashboard so the Report can be accessed by the user within an Assessment Context.</P><P>In an observation that is used as an attribute for the Assessment Observation RTF Command, the SQL Property "WksG" needs to be used in lieu of the Scripted Property "EWG."&nbsp; The SQL Property "EDD" needs to be used in lieu of the Scripted Property "EDD."&nbsp; (In c_observation_result, property_id 116 needs to be changed to property_id 284.&nbsp; Property_id 117 needs to be changed to 283.)</P><P>As of March 14, 2007, these changes have been made in the Master DB.&nbsp; The Master DB OB AP Report on the OB Assessment Dashboard can be used as an example of how to do this configuration.</P></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
