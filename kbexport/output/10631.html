<h1>Practice Management Interface not picking up the phone number if they are spaces instead of hypen in the phone numbers</h1><h2>10631</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>this article explains why the PM interface does not show the phone numbers if the PM systems sends that in the format of spaces in between instead of hypen or other delimiters.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p><FONT size=2><P>Unfortunatly the 3rd party tool we use to parse the HL7 messages does not recognize the phone numbers if there are spaces in between. It takes the number if they are no spaces or some delimiters (like hypen -) in between. This is not in our control and we are PLANNING on rewriting our Practice Management Interfaces into XML / .NET based and that should take care these kind of simple issues.. For now YES, it is a known issue with the tool we use it..</P></FONT></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
