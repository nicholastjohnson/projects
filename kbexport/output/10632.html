<h1>Stuck Service Bar in version 2</h1><h2>10632</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p>User clicks on a service bar (almost always a testperform or administer immunization) and nothing happens (except they take over the service bar.)</p><h3>Cause</h3><p>There is a mismatch between the service bar and the treatment. (I don't know why this happens)</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>none</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Find the patient's cpr_id in p_patient.Filter for that cpr_id in p_treatment_item and find the treatment_id attached to the "stuck" service bar.Filter for the cpr_id (NOT the treatment_id) in p_encounter_log and filter-exclude rows with the status of COMPLETE.  There should be a row with a status of READY with a description matching the treatment.  If you look at the treatment_id for that row, it will probably be one or a few numbers off of the treatment_id you found in p_treatment_item.  Replace the treatment_id value in p_Encounter_Log with the value from p_treatment_item.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
