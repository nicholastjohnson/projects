The registry can not process the files that has no address information and so all the JMJ customers are advised to fill the Patient Address and other basic informations that is necessary in order for the vaccine messages to successfully post into the FL registry system.</P><P>Feel free to contact Diane (<A href="mailto:Diane_McLeod@doh.state.fl.us">Diane_McLeod@doh.state.fl.us</A>) at the FL registry directly if you have any specific questions.</P></p>
