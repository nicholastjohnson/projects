<h1>Un-cancelling leaves CC and comments still missing</h1><h2>10644</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Issue example: Evidently, missing information happens with the "Uncancel Encounter" option.  The office manager called to say that she had uncancelled the encounter, but the CC was missing.  Furthermore, the comments in the "Remarkable Addn'l History" were also not restored.  I suspect that this would be true of free form text found in the physical as well.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>Hotfixes were run out of order.</p><h3>Workaround</h3><p>To fix the encounter, find the encounter_id, then go to p_observation_comment, filter for that encounter_id, and set the current_flags to Y</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Run ALL HOTFIXES in order so that this doesn't happen again.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
