<h1>Troubleshooting Lab Integration Issues</h1><h2>10658</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p></p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>**If you do not already have a CMA username and password, see Chris St. John**</STRONG></FONT></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG></STRONG></FONT></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>1) The practice did not receive the results.</STRONG></FONT></P><P>Sometimes this is just a matter of restarting the services, especially if the status of the results in CMA is "Ready". If that doesn't work, select the results in CMA that need to be resent and resend them. </P><P>If the practice did not receive some results and you cannot find these specific results in CMA, then advise the customer to call the lab company and have them resend those results b/c we have not received them.&nbsp; Or, if you know which folder the lab company is sending the results (either to our server or the customers) you can check that folder to see if we received the results but they produced errors.</P><P></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>2) The practice received the results, but they have posted to the wrong lab.</STRONG></FONT></P><P>This has happened because in the past, someone at the practice manually mismapped these results. Advise the customer that he will need to unmap the results by going to the lab dashboard screen, other options, undo lab map. Then delete that lab, reorder it for the same encounter date, and advise us as to which results we need to resend. Once the results are resent they will be waiting in scan/post to be manually posted.</P><P></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>3) The practice received the results, but they did not automatically post.</STRONG></FONT></P><P>Once results have been manually posted to a certain lab, they will automatically post to that lab thereafter. However, there are some cases in which they will not automatically post even if the results have already been mapped. </P><P>Epro matches the results based on the date that the test was ordered (the results and the test must have the same date!), but occasionally the provider will order the same test on the same day.&nbsp; In this case, the resutls will not auto-post.</P><P>A&nbsp;provider who is behind on charting will send the requisition form to the lab company before she actually orders the lab in Epro. If the results return before the lab is ordered, they will not automatically post. Once results make it to the scan/post page, they will not automatically post. They must be manually posted or deleted.</P><P></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>4) "More than one patient identifier" message when posting results.</STRONG></FONT></P><P>When a user selects results from scan/post to be posted, and clicks "Post", she gets a message saying that Epro has found more than one patient identifier and to only click yes if you are absolutely sure that this is the patient you want. <STRONG>ALWAYS click "No"</STRONG>. This happens because the lab company has sent over a patient id that is different from the Epro billing id. Epro doesn't recognize this id, and if you click yes, a new patient chart will be created. The lab company must either send over the Epro billing id, or no patient id at all. In the absence of an id, Epro will select the patient by name, DOB, and SS#.</P><P></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>5) "Error processing document" message when posting results.</STRONG></FONT></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG></STRONG></FONT><FONT color=#000000>Many times when this happens the file is corrupted. Delete the results, resend them and try to post them again or check to see that they were auto-posted to the chart.</FONT></P><P></P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>6) User is kicked out of Epro while trying to post a document.</STRONG></FONT></P><P>This is usually either a problem caused by the Citrix connection, in which case they may need an upgrade, or it is a matter of running all Office Updates (on server and fat clients).</P><P><FONT color=#0000ff><STRONG>7) User receives and error message after clicking on "post" and/or is unable to post anything.</STRONG></FONT></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: #1f497d; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'"><FONT color=#000000><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">This is different than the issue discussed in 5.&nbsp; This occurs when user clicks "post" in 'Scan/Post', gets an EPRO error pop up and is unable to post any lab for any patient.&nbsp; With Mod Level 128 and above if they are having problems in posting the lab results (it throws error in posting xml document) try installing hotfix 257 which fixes the following error.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
