This is not noticed or reported anywhere and no resolution as this is AHC s/w bug. The good news is EHR-Development is migrating the AHC to XML.NET (Mid 2008 for BETA) and so these kinds of problems will no longer an issue. There is a scheduled job that constantly monitor the checkin and demogfx folder to remove any orphaned files every mid night to reduce this issues.</p>
