<h1>SQL Jobs Error 14274</h1><h2>10668</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Because MS SQL Server 2000 supports multiple instances, the <strong>originating_server</strong> field in the <strong>msdb..sysjobs</strong> table contains the instance name in the format ‘server\instance’. Even for the default server instance, the actual server name is used instead of (local). Problems then start arising when the actual Windows server is renamed and is called something different (which was the case in the testing environment). Any jobs therefore created before the renaming would have the old server name as a reference in the <strong>msdb..sysjobs </strong>table, and when trying to update/delete any of them, SQL Server would just throw a tantrum because the server names now <strong>do not match</strong>.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p><p><strong>Error 14274: Cannot add, update, or delete a job (or its steps or schedules) that originated from an MSX server. The job was not saved.</strong></p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p>Server name does not match the referencing field (originating_server) in msdb..sysjobs table.<br></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p><ol><li>Update the originating_server field in the msdb..sysjobs table to reference the correct server name </li><li>Update/Delete the Job </li><li>Check back in the msdb..sysjobs to see if the delete worked, and hey presto, discover that all references to the job are gone. </li></ol><p>Of course, the above workaround only took place after <strong>all possible backup measures had been implemented</strong>.</p><br><p><br></p><p><br></p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>This problem is apparently known to Microsoft , and they have confirmed its existence. Im not sure if it appears in SQL Server 2005.<br><br>You can Reference Microsoft KB article: 281642<br>But they do not mention the workaround we have described above. theirs consisted or remaning the server, deleting the jobs, rename back to the new server name, then recreate the jobs by running the script. <br>This resolution did not meet out requirements.<br></p>
