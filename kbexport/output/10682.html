<h1>Treatment Attachment Caption printing</h1><h2>10682</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>There's a new attribute to the Treatment Attachment command (and I suppose to all of the other Attachment contexts) that prints out information about the attachment along with it.  Examples are %attachment attached_by(user.user_full_name)%%attachment attachment_date%%attachment attachment_tag%or any other p.attachment field name, I think.  Captions can be separated by carriage returns or spaces.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p></p>
