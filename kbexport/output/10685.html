<h1>How to configure PHINMS Interface</h1><h2>10685</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>this article explains how to verify / configure the PHINMS interface which is used for various (Arkansas) vaccine registry interfaces.</p><h3>Symptom</h3><p></p><h3>Cause</h3><p></p><h3>Workaround</h3><p></p><h3>Resolution</h3><p></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><P>PHINMS (Public Health Information Network Messaging System) 2.1 is what is installed and configured to use for Arkansas Vaccine Registry Interface. The installation and configuration are in EPIE under c:\PHINMS2.1. There is a "PHINMS" database that is installed&nbsp;techserv. There is a route file(*.XML) that needs to be installed and configured in order to change the message routing to destination. Following are the hints on various things to know about PHINMS configuration.</P><P>A) The name of the route PHINMS sender is set to use is in (m_addressee_property (2.0)/m_interface_service_transport_property(EPIE3.0)) as property="routeinfo</P><P>B) If there is a latest CPA file (route info) from the interface partner then drop this file&nbsp;into <A href="file://\\epie\c\phinms2.1\client\config\cpa">\\epie\c\phinms2.1\client\config\cpa</A>. Then go to routemap.xml and add an entry for the new CPA (name, cpa) and then enter the &lt;name&gt; as the value for the property "routeinfo" as explained in step A.</P><P>c) The name of the PHINMS DB and other configuration are defined in sender.xml</P><P>d) When the PHINMS sender sends the message it is queued up in table&nbsp;"transportq_out" in PHINMS DB on techserv&nbsp;with status of "queued" (pending for phinms to transmit).</P><P>e) It is not currently supporting to install the PHINMS2.1 as windows service and so to make this running all the time ask Sumathi/ Mat / Chris / Mark to connect to EPIE in Console (mstsc /console to RDP) and start the "startclient.bat" file to run this service which will transmit the messages to destination.</P><P>f) Whenever a new CPA is sent we have to make sure the new SSL Certificate is also installed.</P><P><BR><BR>&nbsp;</P></p>
