<p>
Codestarter, Inc. ("Codestarter," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Codestarter when you access the Codestarter Service, located at codestarter.org (the "Site"). We will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We treat your personal information as we would and do treat our own.
</p>
<h2>Questions And Concerns</h2>
<p>
If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our Privacy Policy or data collection and processing practices, or if you want to report any security violations to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@codestarter.org">info@codestarter.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>User Consent</h2>
<p>
By submitting Personal Data through our Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>Donors Outside Of The United States</h2>
<p>
If you are non U.S. user of the Site, by visiting the Site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.
</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that web site operators never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting verifiable parental consent. Children who apply to receive a laptop will be directed to submit a signed Parental Consent form before they will be able to proceed with their application. As part of their participation in Codestarter, children will be required to submit online surveys. These questions are general socio-demographic questions, as well as subjective questions about a child’s experience of learning. Codestarter posts our surveys here so that parents, guardians, educators, the children themselves, donors, and the general public can be aware of the information we are collecting. In the event that we determine that a user of this Site is under the age of 13 and has not submitted parental consent, we will not maintain or use his or her personally identifiable information. If you have additional concerns or questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@codestarter.org">info@codestarter.org</a>.
</p>

<li>To (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect the rights and property of Codestarter, our agents, users, coding organization partners, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use; or (iii) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of Codestarter, our users, or any person.</li>

<li>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Information Choices And Changes</h2>
<p>
We want to communicate with you about the great work you are enabling through the Site, but only if you want to hear from us. We try to keep emails to a minimum and give you the ability to opt out by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive or by contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:info@codestarter.org">info@codestarter.org</a>. Despite your indicated email preferences, we may send you service related communications, including emails related to your donations and any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy. You may also send requests about your contact preferences, changes to your information, including requests to opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@codestarter.org">info@codestarter.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>Third-party Services</h2>
<p>
The Service allows donors to create Accounts using third-party services like GitHub and Twitter. Additionally the Service allows donors to access various social networking services ("SNS") such as Twitter, to interact with friends and to share Service related information. We never post any personal information to one of your SNS without your permission.
</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>
We use various technologies to enhance your experience on our Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Site. Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users' personal information.
</p>
<p>
We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>Voluntary Disclosure</h2>
<p>
Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas of the Site, such as in the creation of your Profile, becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information through these public venues.
</p>
<h2>Security Of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>
We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to enter a password to access your Account information. Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Company uses reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, Company cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at <a href="privacy.html">https:&#47;&#47;codestarter.org&#47;privacy</a> and we will change the "Last Updated" date above. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
